"Historical Overview
Multiple religions characterize Brazil as the Church emerged due to the Portuguese conquests. It is believed that the first religion to enter Brazil with the Portuguese was Catholicism. The starting point is the Catholic Mass of 1500, verified by some of the first colonizers. Subject to the strong influence of colonization and the rigidity of their forces, Brazil struggled to cope with the religious onslaught. Missionary and educational activities helped strengthen Catholicism and the formation of elite communities. Although the influence was strong, early Catholicism intertwined traditional motifs and cultural beliefs.
Catholicism spread to Brazil for two centuries: monasteries and indigenous church schools. By 1551 a separate diocese was formed, and then the first bishop became the head of the religious current. By the end of the 17th century, Bahia became the seat of Catholicism, followed by bishoprics in Rio de Janeiro, Pernambuco, and Maranhão. Bishops, orders, and holy clergy led the Catholic Church to unite the people. During the period of Catholicism, the citizens of Brazil fought for their independence, trying to find a way to overthrow the colonial system. Brazilian independence was declared in 1822, after which the first Brazilian constitution was adopted. The constitution regulated the rights and freedoms of Brazilian citizens and freedom of religion. It led to the Roman Catholic Church becoming the state church, so believers were legally protected. In 1889 Brazil declared itself a republic, after which the Church was separated from the state.
Until 1930, the Catholic Church had a strong influence on the population’s life. The Church intervened in public discourse and imposed restrictions on private life. In the 1930s, the Church supported an authoritarian regime, bringing the Church back to the forefront. After World War II, however, Catholicism began to lose its influence. Brazilian citizens were finally able to receive a diverse education, which lowered the status of the Church’s schools. The military dictatorships of 1964 and 1980 were catalysts in the subversion of the population and the Church. Catholicism had divided into currents by the end of the 20th century, with radical or conservative churches responding differently to social problems. Catholicism has declined significantly since the last century due to political and social divisions.
The Current Situation
Brazil is a multireligious country with Protestantism, Orthodox Christianity, marginal communes, and Catholicism. Catholicism is widespread among about two-thirds of the population and permeates various structures: politics is mainly influenced by religion. In Brazil, at least five party formations have incorporated Christian values into their ideological platforms. For example, the Christian Workers Party was formed in 1985 and is a conservative political branch. The Social Democratic Christian Party of Brazil (PSDB) advocates center-right movements toward neoliberalism. Although the religious ideas of public figures are not limited to parties, politicians and officials have certain beliefs broadcast to the public. This presentation leads to social conflicts in electioneering.
The other side of the religious component of Brazilian political life is discrimination. Although Brazil is generally regarded as a country of tolerance, including racial-religious, tolerance figures for minority religions are still far from ideal. In general, the state preserves the rights of citizens to freedom of religion, but there is a pronounced aggressive attitude toward people of Afro-Brazilian faiths. Discrimination cases are pretty frequent, but there are still hotlines, human rights organizations, and structures to promote other religions.
The number of churches in Brazil is nearly 300, with dioceses and archdioceses. Often churches as organizations are vital instruments of pressure on social life. It creates more prejudices about religion, leading to new social conflicts. Although the political situation with religion is unstable, support for the educational aspects is strong. Despite the decline of Catholicism, more than 30 universities in Brazil are supported by the Catholic diocese. The Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais is recognized as the best among the private universities, providing predominantly academic training but with a permanent message of social inclusion.
Competition and discrimination between movements caused Catholicism to surrender to the influence of other denominations. Protestantism in Brazil is growing steadily, the crucial branch being the Pentecostals. Their number reaches about 22% of the country’s population. In the 21st century, we can state that the religious agenda is returning to Brazil. The expansion of the new heavyweights of religious-political space – Protestants and Pentecostals in particular – will be a defining trend in the religious sphere in Brazil in the coming years. With their resources and influence, the Protestants are likely to seriously challenge the traditional player, the Catholic Church."
"Introduction (100 words):
Artesunate is a crucial component of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) used for the treatment of malaria, a life-threatening parasitic disease. This essay aims to discuss the pharmacological properties, mechanism of action, dosage, potential side effects, and nursing considerations of Artesunate as an antimalarial drug. By exploring these aspects, healthcare professionals, including nurses, can gain a comprehensive understanding of this medication to optimize patient care.
Pharmacological Properties (150 words):
Artesunate, belonging to the artemisinin class of antimalarial drugs, is derived from Artemisia annua, commonly known as sweet wormwood. It exhibits outstanding efficacy against Plasmodium falciparum, the most lethal malaria parasite species. Artesunate possesses excellent bioavailability, allowing for rapid absorption after oral or parenteral administration. Its clearance is primarily metabolized to dihydroartemisinin (DHA) in the liver, contributing to its potent antimalarial activity.
Mechanism of Action (150 words):
The precise mechanism of action of Artesunate is not entirely understood; however, it is believed to involve two key processes. Firstly, it converts heme, a toxic byproduct of the malaria parasite's metabolism, into an inert pigment, rendering it harmless. Secondly, Artesunate generates free radicals in the presence of iron, leading to oxidative stress within the parasite. These actions ultimately result in parasite death, reducing the parasitic load and alleviating clinical symptoms.
Dosage (150 words):
The dosage of Artesunate varies depending on the severity of the malaria infection, patient age and weight, and the treatment regimen being used. For uncomplicated malaria treatment, a standard oral dose of 4 mg/kg is administered daily for three days. In severe malaria cases, administration of an initial intravenous (IV) loading dose of 2.4 mg/kg, followed by IV or intramuscular maintenance doses of 1.2 mg/kg every 12 hours for a total of 24 hours, is recommended.
Potential Side Effects (150 words):
While generally well-tolerated, Artesunate may present some potential side effects. Common adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, and dizziness. In rare instances, transient neutropenia or thrombocytopenia may occur. Allergic reactions and hemolysis, especially in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, have been reported but are extremely rare. Long-term use or excessive dosing of Artesunate has also been associated with neurotoxicity, so caution is advised.
Nursing Considerations (200 words):
Nurses play a vital role in the administration and management of Artesunate as an antimalarial drug. Proper assessment of the patient's medical history, including allergies and potential contraindications, is essential before initiating treatment. Artesunate should not be used in the first trimester of pregnancy unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks. Healthcare providers should remain vigilant for signs of drug interactions, particularly with medications known to prolong the QT interval.
Nurses should educate patients on the importance of adhering to the prescribed treatment regimen and emphasize the significance of completing the full course to prevent treatment failure and the development of drug resistance. Monitoring for clinical response, including resolution of fever and parasite clearance, is crucial to evaluate treatment effectiveness.
Additionally, nurses should provide adequate information regarding potential side effects and instruct patients on managing these symptoms, such as taking Artesunate with food to reduce gastrointestinal disturbances. Close monitoring of renal and hepatic function is also necessary to ensure the drug's safety and effectiveness.
Conclusion (50 words):
Artesunate, with its remarkable pharmacological properties and mechanism of action, has proven to be a highly effective antimalarial drug. By understanding appropriate dosing, potential side effects, and nursing considerations, healthcare professionals can optimize patient outcomes and contribute to efforts in preventing and treating malaria."
"Thich Quang Duc committed self-immolation on the streets of Saigon on June 11, 1963, and it changed the course of history. Today, the photograph of Thich Quang Duc’s death, The Burning Monk, has become a universal symbol of rebellion and the fight against injustice. His death was reduced to a symbol, but it was much more than that (Sinzelle, 22). It was an act of defiance against a corrupt government that had killed its citizens. It sparked a revolution, overthrew the regime, and may even have caused the Americans to enter the Vietnam War. However, the monk himself most likely did not die for revolutionary ideas. His self-immolation was an act of rejection of the system and the inability to deal with injustice.
Tunisian street vendor Mohammed Bouazizi set himself on fire in protest against harassment by local officials. The desperate act of the young man caused mass street protests in the city. The rioters demanded the resignation of President Ben Ali. His political regime faced long-term economic and social problems, resulting in unemployment, mostly among young people. Mohammed Bouazizi became a symbol of the Arab Spring; he gained followers in Tunisia and other Arab countries, which also led to mass protests.
Most of the self-immolations did not impact the current situation; however, some of them played an important role in the political events in the country in which they took place. The actions of both men can hardly be called a specific call for revolution. Both cases can be compared, considering them as an extreme measure of disagreement with injustice. It seems that the men have no other means left for the official authorities to hear them. In one way or another, both events significantly influenced the course of history."
"Osteoarthritis is a chronic degenerative joint disease that affects millions of people worldwide. It is a leading cause of pain and disability, often impacting the quality of life for those affected. However, despite its prevalence, there are several challenges and misconceptions surrounding the treatment of osteoarthritis. In order to address these issues effectively, a comprehensive approach that incorporates rehabilitation counseling can prove beneficial.
One of the primary challenges of treating osteoarthritis is the misconception that it is an inevitable consequence of aging. Many individuals believe that nothing can be done to prevent or manage the condition, leading to a lack of proactive measures. However, research has shown that lifestyle modifications, such as exercise and weight management, can significantly reduce pain and improve joint function. Rehabilitation counseling can play a pivotal role in educating individuals about these interventions, empowering them to take control of their condition.
Another challenge is the reliance on medication as the primary form of treatment. While pain medications may provide temporary relief, they do not address the underlying causes of osteoarthritis or promote long-term joint health. Rehabilitation counseling can introduce alternative approaches, such as physical therapy and occupational therapy, which focus on strengthening joints, improving flexibility, and employing adaptive strategies to manage daily activities. By incorporating these therapies into the treatment plan, individuals can enhance their functional abilities and maintain independent lifestyles.
Furthermore, the psychosocial aspect of osteoarthritis is often overlooked but equally significant. Those affected may experience feelings of frustration, depression, and social isolation due to the limitations imposed by the condition. Rehabilitation counseling can provide psychosocial support, helping individuals cope with these challenges, and offering strategies to manage the emotional impact of osteoarthritis. Additionally, counseling can facilitate the adjustment to lifestyle changes, including modifications in work, leisure activities, and personal relationships.
In conclusion, the challenges and misconceptions surrounding the treatment of osteoarthritis underscore the need for a comprehensive approach that incorporates rehabilitation counseling. By dispelling common misconceptions, promoting lifestyle modifications, and addressing the psychosocial impact of the condition, rehabilitation counseling can significantly improve the management of osteoarthritis. With the integration of counseling into the treatment plan, individuals can be empowered to take an active role in their own care, leading to better outcomes and an improved quality of life."
"Economic globalization is an inevitable process due to many reasons, but many people argue that it has a detrimental effect on the development of many countries or even the entire world. Nevertheless, globalization positively influences the evolution of human society at large, although some adverse effects are apparent (Wade, 2004). First, it is essential to understand the benefits of economic globalization to embrace it rather than try to oppose it.
Undoubtedly, economic globalization enables people to trade more efficiently and effectively as they have access to diverse resources and markets. An entrepreneur in every part of the world can offer products and services to people from other continents with the help of technology. The abundance of ideas contributes to the creation of new products making people’s lives more comfortable (Sen, 2012). Individuals, companies, and countries can collaborate to conduct complex projects.
However, such aspects as inequality are often raised in relation to economic globalization. It is argued that globalization is a manifestation of western imperialism as rich countries exploit the resources of developing countries (Sen, 2012). As a result, the opponents of globalization argue poor countries become even poorer. However, it is found that globalization is not directly linked to poverty and equality (Wade, 2004). Poor countries’ governments’ inability to cope with corruption and the lack of flexibility to adapt to new technological and cultural realms leads to inequality. Moreover, Sen (2012) stresses that emerging countries can and will also benefit from economic globalization if specific measures are undertaken. Thus, technologically advanced countries must be responsible in terms of using resources (supplied by developing countries), and developing countries must be committed to change and social stability within their boundaries (eliminating corruption and other issues). All in all, globalization can make all societies better and even contribute to the decrease in inequality globally."
"Social media platforms have complicated algorithms which propose information or advertising according to the users’ interests. For instance, the work of those algorithms can be easily seen in TikTok by watching an interesting video. The app can categorize the topics and propose similar videos to maintain the attention of the user. To prove this theory, I started to watch many videos about ice-skating. Consequently, every third video on ticktock was related to this specific topic. When I scroll down ice-skating videos without watching them, they start to appear rarely in my TikTok field. The same algorithm works when I start skipping interesting videos and watching something I did. It becomes difficult to return videos that I like as the algorithm follows all my actions.
Instagram and YouTube have the same algorithm system, and the proposed advertising is usually based on past Google research. For instance, recently, I have been looking for a new pair of shoes, and a huge number of advertisements started to be shown while watching videos on YouTube or while watching stories on Instagram. Moreover, some algorithms have the ability to remember audio, and while talking to someone, the systems catch different product names, and promotions can appear in the social media field. On the one hand, this technology might be helpful as people can see different information according to their interests. Moreover, advertisements might not be disruptive and sometimes propose needed products. However, as long as phones and other gadgets might hear what people are talking about and send this information to the artificial intelligence which produces algorithms, it might be scary for some people, and the trust level might decrease."
"Introduction:
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted communities worldwide, but the United States has witnessed a disproportionate burden on minority communities. This essay aims to analyze the disparities in knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) levels regarding COVID-19 among different racial and ethnic groups in the United States and how these disparities contribute to the unequal impact on minority communities. By understanding these disparities, we can address the underlying factors, develop targeted interventions, and strive for equitable outcomes.
Body:
1. Disparities in Knowledge:
One significant factor influencing the unequal impact is the disparities in knowledge levels regarding COVID-19. Research suggests that minority communities, especially African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans, possess lower levels of COVID-19 knowledge compared to their white counterparts. Contributing factors include language barriers, limited access to accurate information, and historical distrust in the healthcare system. This knowledge gap hinders individuals' ability to make informed decisions, such as seeking timely medical assistance or adopting preventive measures.
2. Disparities in Attitudes:
Attitudes towards COVID-19 also contribute to the unequal impact. Minority communities often face unique sociocultural challenges that impact their attitudes towards the pandemic. For instance, cultural practices, social gatherings, and reliance on extended families may influence the willingness to adhere to public health guidelines. Additionally, historical experiences of discrimination and structural inequalities can foster mistrust towards public health messaging, leading to a lack of motivation to follow preventive measures. These attitudes can increase the risk of infections within minority communities, exacerbating the unequal impact.
3. Disparities in Practices:
Disparities in COVID-19 practices, such as mask usage, social distancing, and accessing testing and healthcare, further contribute to the inequitable impact on minority communities. Structural factors, including limited access to quality healthcare, financial constraints, and occupational exposure, often affect minority populations to a larger extent, making compliance with preventive measures challenging. Furthermore, frontline workers from minority communities, who bear a higher risk of exposure, may face inadequate protective measures, exacerbating the disparities in practices and increasing the likelihood of infection transmission within these communities.
4. Consequences of Disparities:
The unequal impact of the pandemic on minority communities has severe consequences. Studies indicate that African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans are more likely to experience higher infection rates, hospitalizations, and mortality rates compared to their white counterparts. These disparities are rooted in systemic racism, socioeconomic inequalities, and limited access to healthcare resources. The consequences not only result in increased morbidity and mortality rates but also perpetuate existing social and economic disparities in minority communities.
5. Addressing Disparities:
To address the unequal impact, it is crucial to implement targeted interventions. Priority should be given to enhancing COVID-19 education and awareness programs within minority communities, providing culturally tailored information in multiple languages to ensure equitable access for all. Building trust through community engagement, by involving community leaders, health advocates, and influencers, can foster positive attitudes towards COVID-19 preventive measures. Additionally, efforts must be made to improve the accessibility and affordability of testing and healthcare in these communities, ensuring that preventive resources are readily available and reaching those who need them the most.
Conclusion:
The disparities in knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) levels regarding COVID-19 among different racial and ethnic groups in the United States significantly contribute to the unequal impact on minority communities. Understanding these disparities is essential for implementing targeted interventions to bridge the gap and promote equitable outcomes. By addressing the challenges faced by minority communities, we can collectively work towards mitigating the impact of the pandemic and fostering a more inclusive and resilient society."
"Guaman Poma witnessed the injustices of the colonial government and personally suffered by its hands. He was the descendant of Incan noblemen who grew up after the conquest of Peru by the Spanish. His family was stripped of their lands and titles, and his attempts to regain them were continuously rebuffed by the colonial government (Kilroy-Ewbank, n.d.). Although he initially worked with the colonialists, Poma was exiled for supposedly false claims of nobility and then decided to publicly denounce the Spanish treatment of natives. He published a 1200-page illustrated document addressed to the Spanish king, chronicling the Andean way of life before invasion and the abuses they had suffered since under the Conquistadors.
Poma’s manuscript illustrates the full horrors of colonialism and argues that the Spanish were foreign settlers who had no right to take control of the land God had given to Peruvians. He proposes a system of political organization wherein the government is representative of its people and adapted to their practical needs (Kilroy-Ewbank, n.d.). Poma has thus made a significant contribution to the discussions of liberty, political representation, social responsibility, and self-determinacy of individual states. His notion that the government should be created for and by the people that have historically occupied the land it rules over is strikingly modern.
Furthermore, Poma’s work completely refutes the idea that Europeans brought civilization and political organization to the Incas. This interpretation is revealed as only a hypocritical pretense to justify violence, economic exploitation, and cultural erasure as a means of political control. It portrays how an entire way of life was completely destroyed and lost as its people were deprived of their freedom and forced to assimilate. Although Poma admires the moral standards the Spanish purport to uphold, he shows that they have not actually measured up to them."
"The telescope has undoubtedly played a pivotal role in the advancement of astronomy. It has not only allowed scientists to gather new data but has also opened the doors to many groundbreaking discoveries. However, it is important to recognize the limitations of telescopes as the sole source of achieving significant results in the field of astronomy. Moreover, the contribution of other sciences, such as physics and chemistry, has been instrumental in driving the technological advancements in astrophysics and astronomy.
The telescope revolutionized the way we observe the universe by enabling us to gather data that was previously unattainable. By collecting and analyzing electromagnetic radiation from distant celestial bodies, astronomers have been able to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos. The telescope has allowed us to observe the birth and death of stars, identify exoplanets, study distant galaxies, and even explore the cosmic microwave background radiation. These discoveries have greatly expanded our knowledge of the universe and have challenged existing theories.
However, it is important to recognize the limitations of telescopes as the sole source of achieving significant results in astronomy. One limitation is that telescopes can only detect electromagnetic radiation and are therefore limited to studying objects that emit or reflect such radiation. This limits our ability to study objects that do not emit or interact with electromagnetic radiation, such as dark matter. Additionally, telescopes are susceptible to atmospheric interference, which can distort or obscure the data being collected. Despite the development of advanced techniques to mitigate these issues, atmospheric interference remains a significant challenge in astronomical research.
Furthermore, other scientific disciplines, particularly physics and chemistry, have made substantial contributions to the technological advancements in astrophysics and astronomy. Physics provides the theoretical framework for understanding celestial phenomena. For instance, Einstein's theory of general relativity has revolutionized our understanding of gravity and has been instrumental in explaining the behavior of massive celestial objects like black holes. Additionally, advances in physics have led to the development of advanced imaging techniques such as adaptive optics, which compensates for atmospheric distortions in real-time.
Chemistry has also played a crucial role in the technological advancements in astronomy. Spectroscopy, a branch of chemistry, enables scientists to analyze the chemical composition of celestial objects by studying the spectra of light emitted or absorbed by these objects. Through spectroscopy, astronomers have been able to identify the elemental composition of stars, study the atmospheres of exoplanets, and even detect complex organic molecules in space. These advancements in chemical analysis have provided valuable insights into the origins and composition of celestial objects.
In conclusion, the telescope has undeniably played a vital role in the advancement of astronomy by allowing scientists to gather new data and make groundbreaking discoveries. However, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of telescopes as the sole source of achieving significant results in the field. The contributions of other sciences, such as physics and chemistry, have been key in driving the technological advancements in astrophysics and astronomy. By collaborating and integrating knowledge from different scientific disciplines, we can continue pushing the boundaries of our understanding of the universe."
"Ethics shape the state of many businesses and display the owners’ intentions towards bettering the consumers’ lives. Ethical considerations are rules that the company should adhere to while making significant decisions concerning their customers and creditors (Schmitz & Leoni, 2019). The integrity of Key West Stores is an ethical consideration since it affects the business’s operations. Accountant does not display integrity in their job and place themselves at risk since the creditors are offended. It is also unfair when the business transfers the blame to the mailroom and the post office, knowing they are liable for the delay in delivery of the checks. It is unethical for Key West Stores to hold the bills and lie to their creditors to avoid penalties.
The stakeholders affected negatively by the conspiracy are the creditors, the mailroom, and the post office. Whereas the creditors lose money by paying more interest, the mailroom and the post office blame the delays in the checks. The creditors cannot complain since they are dependent on the business and thus pay for the excessively demanded money by Key West Stores. Conversely, the firm earns from the perfected delays hence the only party that benefits. Tiffany Lyons is another party that may be a victim of the activities. It will derail her emotions if she is not okay with conducting the lies.
Tiffany should not continue with the immoral practices started by Jay because they place her at risk of losing her trustworthiness in the organization. The business should give her a position to conduct her duty without oppression. It is Tiffany’s right to protect her reputation in the industry by opposing behaviors that put her at risk of losing her job. If she continues perpetrating the delays, her integrity becomes questionable, and she does not fit to stand for the position of assistant accountant. Jay has a chance to refuse to continue the delays if she is willing to protect her future career as an accountant. It is against the Financial Accounting Standards to delay accounting information since it affects decision-making by the users of accounting information. If the employer denies her a chance in the office due to her integrity levels, Tiffany may opt to leave the job and protect her image as a professional accountant.
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) compiles specific standards for accountants and provides them with codes of conduct that guide accountants on various behaviors. The business defies the integrity and objectivity rule that requires professional accountants to remain steadfast in matters that require integrity and professionalism (AICPA, 2016). The integrity and objectivity of an accountant is a professional code of conduct that is vital for image building and professionalism. Accountants should be truthful and reliable when passing information. They should also be timely in the operations to give the statements timelessness. When information is timeless, it is useful for informed and timely decisions. Key West Stores should correct their behavior for ethical continuity.
As the assistant accountant, I would write to the management to inform them about my unwillingness to participate in fraud. Later, based on the management’s response to my decision, I would determine the next course of action. If the management is aware of the unfair dealings and keeps supporting them, I would quit the office to protect my image and professionalism. However, if the management supports my plea to convert the wrong dealings, I would accept the offer and work as an accountable, transparent, and reliable assistant accountant by delivering the checks within the appropriately scheduled time. Besides, I can act as a whistleblower to alarm the outside world about the fraudulent actions of the Key West Store."
"Financial indicators play a crucial role in helping individuals and organizations make profitable financial decisions and improve overall success. These indicators provide valuable insights into the financial health and performance of an organization, enabling stakeholders to assess its profitability, liquidity, and stability. By analyzing these indicators, decision-makers can make informed choices, allocate resources efficiently, and identify areas for improvement. This essay will discuss the importance of financial indicators in making profitable financial decisions and improving the success of organizations, with examples and evidence from both the essay and external sources.
One significant financial indicator is the return on investment (ROI), which measures the profitability of an investment relative to its cost. A high ROI indicates that the investment is yielding substantial returns, while a low ROI suggests inefficiency or even losses. For example, VentureBeat reported that Apple's decision to invest heavily in research and development for the iPhone resulted in a significant increase in ROI, leading to tremendous financial success for the company. Knowledge of the ROI can guide organizations in choosing investments that are likely to generate profitable outcomes.
Furthermore, financial indicators like liquidity ratios help organizations determine their ability to meet short-term financial obligations. The current ratio, for instance, compares current assets to current liabilities, providing insights into a company's immediate financial health. Higher liquidity ratios indicate better financial stability, thereby reducing the risk of insolvency. An example of the importance of liquidity ratios can be seen during the global financial crisis of 2008, where organizations with low liquidity struggled to obtain necessary funding and experienced severe financial consequences as a result.
Additionally, financial indicators such as gross profit margin and operating profit margin analyze the efficiency of a company's operations and its ability to generate profit. For instance, a high operating profit margin implies that a company is generating a significant profit from its operations after deducting variable costs. This indicator helps identify potential cost-cutting opportunities or areas where revenue generation can be improved. In a study conducted by Bain & Company, it was found that companies with higher operating profit margins consistently outperformed their industry peers, demonstrating the importance of this indicator in overall success.
In conclusion, financial indicators provide crucial information for decision-makers in making profitable financial decisions and improving the success of organizations. Whether it is understanding the ROI, assessing liquidity, or measuring profitability, these indicators guide stakeholders towards optimal resource allocation and strategic decisions. Through a careful analysis of financial indicators, organizations can identify areas for improvement, reduce financial risks, and enhance their overall performance. Consequently, understanding and utilizing financial indicators is essential for making sound financial decisions and ensuring the long-term success of organizations."
"The story of medical research has been rather unkind to women, often neglecting the differences of the female anatomy and failing to acknowledge female-specific issues, centering on male ones. However, even when healthcare research does prioritize women, the manner in which it does so often remains quite deplorable, as the case of Henrietta Lacks demonstrates. Representing a case of blatant abuse of women’s rights, as well as unmasked racism and neglect for patient’s dignity, the case of Henrietta Lacks stirred the global community, yet it was only Rebecca Skloot who did Lacks’ narrative justice. By pinpointing the nature of the problem, specifically, outlining racism and disregard for the integrity of women’s bodily autonomy, Skloot condemns the abuse that Lacks suffered, therefore, paving the way to new, fair and unbiased, medical research.
What makes Skloot’s work remarkable is the focus of the narrative. Specifically, Skloot does not diminish the significance and effect of the discovery that researchers made. Indeed, the discovery of HeLa cells can be seen as a massive breakthrough in addressing the issues of social, academic, and racial injustice observed in the case under analysis. Instead, Skloot appeals to the principles of research participants’ autonomy and the fundamental rights of an individual, particularly, the right to bodily integrity: “All I remember is that she had this disease, and right after she died they called me in the office wanting to get my permission to take a sample of some kind. I decided not to let them” (Skloot). Thus, the plight of the narrator becomes especially reasonable and easy to understand.
Moreover, the sociocultural issues that can be seen as prerequisites to the case have been discussed profusely and with due insight in the narrative. Specifically, Skloot outlines the role of racism in the choices that researchers made when deciding to conceal the nature of the medical process to which Lacks was subjected. Namely, Skloot states that African American women, in general, have been silenced for quite long: “But one member of the family remained voiceless: Henrietta’s daughter, Deborah” (Skloot). The presence of racial injustice makes Lacks’ plight particularly sympathetic and her case especially deplorable. Namely, Skloot explains quite expressively that, by denying Lacks her right to opt for participating in the experiment and donating her cells for the sake of the further promotion of cancer research, the people coordinating the experiment showed their disregard for Lacks’ humanity: “Then, matter-of-factly, almost as an afterthought, he said, ‘She was a black woman.’ He erased her name in one fast swipe and blew the chalk from his hands. Class was over” (Skloot). The specified passage renders the indifference of the academia toward vulnerable populations, namely, African American women, as well as women belonging to other minority races and ethnicities. Therefore, Skloot manages to represent the injustice of what has been done to Stock, while also giving credit to researchers for the advancement of healthcare that they promoted.
By emphasizing the injustice and racism that Lacks suffered, having been subjected to extraordinarily biased research with no regard for the bodily autonomy of hers, Skloot addresses Lacks’ case in a very straightforward and unapologetic manner. Skloot manages to balance between acknowledging the importance of research and the necessity to recognize the rights of minority groups, thus, delivering a compelling and thought-provoking message. Encouraging compassion to the victims of systemic injustice, particularly, racism, Skloot creates the narrative that elicits deep sympathy for Lacks and at the same time promotes the importance of combatting racism. Namely, the story focuses on the need to recognize the humanity of oppressed groups, especially African American women, who have been subjected to a variety of injustices, the denial of their dignity and autonomy being one of the most egregious examples."
"As one reads the Gospel, discrepancies and sometimes even contradictions between the texts may be noticed. On the contrary, the descriptions of some of the stories in the Gospels are the same word for word, as if they were copied by one author from another. This phenomenon is called the synoptic problem in scientific biblical scholarship and has been studied for centuries. From the four Gospels, the works of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John Chris are called synoptic (Bakker & Jong, 2021). There are many literary overlaps between these four texts, the study of which will be presented in this paper.
To begin with, it is worth discussing the commonalities of the three authors – Matthew, Mark and Luke. In general terms, the pattern of similarities and differences between the Synoptics can be described as follows. Some of Christ’s actions and teachings are described by all three evangelists, while others are described by only two or one. From this, scholars have concluded that each author of the Gospels has the same content with the other two Synoptics or with any one of them and exclusively their own content not found in any other (Bakker & Jong, 2021). For example, Mark’s Gospel’s original content is 30 verses out of more than 650. Hence, 600-plus verses from Mark are found in Matthew and Luke’s works. Conventionally, the total content in Matthew and Luke is approximately 240 verses. The original content in Matthew is about 1/6 of the total, in Luke about 1/4 (Farrugia, 2020). Interestingly, both the original content of Matthew and Luke and the total content of both deal primarily with the Savior’s words, not His actions. The discrepancies in the texts of the Evangelists are also due to following different traditions of retelling events.
For example, Matthew and Luke follow one tradition of retelling the parable of the workers in the vineyard, while Mark follows a different tradition. As for John Chris, many of the events and teachings of Christ in the Fourth Gospel are a particular text peculiar only to John. This is not to say that there is no connection between Synoptics and John, but it is not apparent. Christ’s conversations with Nicodemus and the Samaritan woman, the conversation about the bread that came down from heaven, the raising of Lazarus are not only theologically significant passages mentioned exclusively in John (Gathercole, 2020). They are unique and vital even in terms of the text structure – extensive and detailed as compared to the way the Synoptics present the material. Along with this, there is a discrepancy with the other evangelists about the day of Passover and the absence of the moment of the apostles’ communion in the description of the Last Supper. All of the above forces biblical scholars to put the question of the relationship between the Gospel of John and the Synoptics beyond the synoptic problem.
One can conclude that the texts of the three authors, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, are, for the most part, similar. Their main differences lie in their use of various traditions of interpretation and retelling (Norouzi & Jalali, 2020). The texts of John Chris are significantly different from the others because they have fragments that are peculiar only to this author’s writing. Nevertheless, there are commonalities, such as retelling significant events, which is similar in all four authors."
"Introduction:
Nursing associations play a crucial role in promoting the advancement of the nursing profession and facilitating the growth of nurse practitioners.

"Goals and objectives outline desired outcomes and, thus, are often used interchangeably. However, the effect, timeframe, and specificity of the two terms set them apart. Nickels et al. (2019) define goals as broad and long-term outcomes that an organization seeks, while objectives define the measurable, specific, and short-term strategies for attaining the identified goal. For example, the criminal justice system uses goals to task the police, correctional agencies, and the court with the strategy to execute, including deterrence, rehabilitation, retribution, restoration, and incapacitation. Therefore, the criminal justice system particularly addresses criminal behavior with the objective of protecting people’s rights.
In an era of rapid change, diversity, and complexity, leadership and management are critical to the survival of any agency. Besides, the ability to lead and manage strongly permeates every aspect of the criminal justice system. While leaders guide the change through a vision, managers implement coordinated processes and structures to pursue organizational goals and objectives (Nickels et al., 2019). Leaders are constantly challenged to take risks and encourage transformation. In law enforcement, for example, police leaders must develop and instill high standards in other officers to work toward the same goal. Beyond leadership, criminal justice relies on managers to optimize processes and lead efforts toward reliable outcomes. Generally, criminal justice leaders and managers work effectively to balance ethical and legal considerations.
Earning a degree in criminal justice would significantly contribute to meeting my long-term goals. I have always taken pride in influencing change as a leader. However, I must leverage my education with experience in the criminal justice system to become more efficient and productive. The criminal justice system is becoming increasingly complex and requires more lasting and transformative trends. As such, the second goal is to become more adaptable to change. Bringing significant change through robust analytical skills is an objective in itself. Also, gaining strong relational skills to work with professionals and serve people from diverse backgrounds."
"The term “confession” has several meanings, such as admitting one’s sins and being ready to repent. Augustine began working on the C onfessions when he was probably 43 years old (Teubner 1). There is no precise, clear motivation to write his own, but there may be at least two possible factors. First, his people were suspicious of his ideal standards, his career as a bright teacher of rhetoric, pagan-influenced education, his known reputation as an ex-Manichee (Teubner 57). By writing the confession, he would defend himself from this kind of criticism and demonstrate that his faith and beliefs were pure Christians. Another possible motivational possibility may have been brought up by his close friendship with Alypius, Christian converts such as Paulinus Nola, who renounced the world and his immense family fortune after his conversion to Christianity.
The C onfession comprises 13 Books; books 1 to 9 recount Augustine’s life and spiritual journey, while book 10 shows the temptations, he was still facing. Books 11 to 13 are the extensions of the first chapter of Genesis. The first ten books were about Agustine, while the last three were about the scripture. All the Confessions had many themes such as nature of evil, sin, time, sufferings, lust, truth, wisdom and knowledge, weakness, pride, internal peace. According to Augustine, God cannot be the cause of evil. For Augustine says, “evil does not exist”(Teubner 78). Evil lacks good, and evil exists as long as good is absent.
Saint Augustine’s Confessions have a unified theme of inner peace. His reflections on it seem to bring his deliberate state of spiritual and psychological calmness, despite the burdens and stressors in his journey. He believes that human beings cannot find inner peace without involving God; he believes human beings were made to seek peace in God. There is excellent echoing of the solid ethical foundation portrayed by ancient philosophers as Neoplatonic and the Pythagoras vis a vis beauty; these are Augustine’s favorite themes.
Augustine was a student at Carthage, and he was troubled by troublers who interrupted his classes there, rendering him among the critical students who refused to pay their fees. In addition to that, he was financially inconvenienced (Teubner 157). Notwithstanding his disconcertment, he wishes and reassured that such students would be preferred to learn to money. He furthermore says, “You, O God, the truth and fullness of our sure good, and our purest peace” (Augustine 126). Despite being stressed, Augustine remains psychologically calm, thus concluding that inner peace is achievable whatever the situation.
At the time, Saint Augustine was describing the decision to resign his professorship after an upcoming vacation in the autumn holidays, with his chest problems giving him a further excuse to resign. He mentions to his students “who did not meditate on Your law or Your peace, but on foolish lies and legal battles” (Augustine 79). He continues by giving an extended analysis of the scripture in Psalms 4. Music was Augustine’s interest; he introduced the idea of singing psalms during the time of distress via the story of Ambrose’s Basilica. Shifting gears, love, according to Augustine, is not limited to human beings alone. But Love expands to God’s love for human beings, the love that the inanimate beings have for their natural lives. When it comes to humans, their love is multidimensional; it grows from one stage to another: love at infancy; love at adolescence; love for interests and desires.
From his infancy, Augustine indicates that he could not speak and yet he could sense bitterness and jealous in others. From the above statement, we can understand that Augustine never is fond of infants. Throughout infancy, infants would take everything selfishly for themselves only, constantly crying to be given attention and not to be ignored, to be loved only (Teubner 57). Infant’s love can only be described as love for hunger which demands to be filled, or love for pleasure that requires to be filled with comfort. That is why Augustine claims that love is one of the origins of sin; even at birth, everyone is got sin in them.
Next, the author analyzes the stages of love in adolescence. At this stage, humans start to experience different types of love. Here they will begin having desires to love, be loved, pleasures, love for earthly materials. Augustine says in his second book, “The single desire that dominated my search for delight was simply to love and be loved” (Augustine 144). He claims that humans’ thoughts of erotic desires of wanting to love or be loved could be the way that can lead to God or lead them astray from God.
Augustine attends a theatre show to understand human emotions and existence in another instance to feel the pleasure and love; desires of crying, weeping, laughing, and passion. It is clear that he wished to enjoy these desires and likes but realized gradually that as he enjoys giving into his desires, it led him astray from God’s path into alienation. Confessions has a central topic of sin, mercy, and fleeing. For the most of his life, Saint Augustine looked to be avoiding Christianity by engaging in practices and cults such as Manichaeism. Also, he is entombed in a sea of passion. He is avoiding confession because he does not believe he has what it takes to live a life consistent with the teachings of the Bible. Through the audience of sinners, this book had an impact on the Middle East. This book teaches the reader exactly what sin and confession look like in real life.
A topological understanding of how to confess and become a Christian is also imparted to the audience. In Augustine’s stories, the audience connects with them because they are relatable. Preachers who seek to reach out to the lost can find inspiration in this memoir. Inquiring minds who doubt their own misdeeds and God. This personal book shows those who have committed grave crimes that God is able to pardon them all. Many big crimes were committed by Saint Augustine, and he even challenges the Lord, “Why do you demand me to love you?” (Augustine 24). Augustine was saved by God’s grace despite his many transgressions.
Augustine introduces freedom as another set of theme that is evident in Confession. He says freedom is a man’s ability to freely have the presence of ‘evil will’ within the man’s soul. “They say this is the soul, enslaved, contaminated and corrupt…” (Augustine, 79). Free will is human desire that comes from the perfection of God’s steadfast love; this gives humans the ability to do anything freely. This proves that humans were made of God’s likeness and image.
However, freedom is not to be mistakenly used as an excuse for breaking the rules and guidelines to do anything illegal from someone’s locale. There are consequences to be met; thus, we are not free to perform actions without them being checked into balance. Augustine says, “I directed my mind to understand what I was being told, namely that the free choice of the will is the reason why we do wrong and suffer your just judgment” (Augustine 256). From his statement, we can note that freedom is the beginning of evil; as stated earlier that ‘evil will’ stay within humans’ souls. Therefore, it can be said that it is in humans’ nature that when they get any freedom, they will commit evil.
Augustine was faced with other challenges that later affected his general growth, especially while at school. In Carthage, Augustine came across a quote in the book Hortensias by Cicero, which says, “It is the pursuit of truth through a philosophy that leads a person to a thoroughly happy life” (Augustine 122). This line of quote impacted Augustine’s life and affected his growth. Still, in Carthage, he came across the Bible. Still, he had a negative attitude at first sight on the Bible since he thought the Bible was not as much comprehensive and philosophical as he wanted. But when his friend Alypius hinted about the monks that he had come across on his tour from Egypt, seeking the spiritual truth. Augustine felt humiliated and started seeking the truth about faith, and thus it led him to give up all the earthly things and started concentrating on the Godly ways.
In the City of God, Augustine considers fall of Adam as both a secret and an open sin. Its secrecy is brought about by how Adam was perceived as being superior over Eve but was easily convinced to eating the fruit of tree of knowledge. Its openness is seen as Adam directly disobeyed God by eating the forbidden fruit. Thus, Adam’s disobedience can be seen as self-exaltation of Adam as God and this leads to his falling from God’s grace. Sin can be said to be individuals’ self-exaltation to be as God before others like Adam turning from light to be the light himself.
After Augustine had a repetition of the fall, he plunged himself into the sea of lust. According to City of God, what were the consequences of lust? The way of the earthly city is outlined as a way of lust, where one turns to the good of the world for themselves. Sexual lust is obvious evidence of a misdirected love, here the body is in control and refuses to listen to the spirit hence pulling the spirit into earthly pleasures. The consequence of lust is death as the connection between the two is well clear.
In conclusion, Saint Augustine’s Confession contains many different themes but putting more emphasis on sin. In his writing, he shows how sin leads us to God or astray from God. These themes are pretty related to those studies in other texts by authors such as Aristotle, Plato, and Euclid."

"Confidence intervals are statistical tools that help measure the uncertainty of a sampled variable. Due to technical limitations and a lack of resources, researchers cannot use the general population, so they have to restrict themselves to small representative samples. Extrapolating the measured value from the sample to the population is risky, so confidence intervals can reduce this uncertainty (El-Masri, 2012). In the clinical sciences, the use of confidence intervals proves crucial because it minimizes threats to public health by specifying quantities. For example, when developing drugs in market quantities, it is critical to use the exact value of the active agent, and using a 99% confidence interval creates a requirement of near-analytical accuracy for calculating the mass of that substance. Another example is comparing the results of multiple patient-responder groups to develop preventive measures for reliable results (El-Masri, 2012). In fact, there are more opportunities to use confidence intervals of varying accuracy in health care. For population mortality counts, including COVID-19, it is critical to be consistent and provide the most reliable statistical measurements. A confidence interval allows us to cover the weakness in the form of uncertainties due to natural variation and dynamics. Thus, confidence intervals in the medical sciences are used to improve accuracy and minimize errors, the price of which can be equal to human lives and health.
A convenience sampling method was used to collect the ten growth data, which consisted of interviewing the respondents most conveniently available to the experiment initiator. Not every person in the population had an equally likely chance of being selected for the study, and thus the likelihood of systematic errors and bias increased. Instead, I could divide the class into separate clusters so that they differed significantly from each other (McCombes, 2019). I would select 1-2 respondents from each cluster to increase diversity and representativeness: this is a stratified sampling method. However, it is not known for certain where and how the data was collected by the professor.
  * For a sample of twenty respondents, the mean was 70.4.
  * Using MS Excel, a 95% confidence interval was calculated for the previously calculated mean. This was as follows: 95% [66.6, 74.2].
  * The 95% confidence interval was that the true mean height for the general population was between 66.6 and 74.2 inches.
It is well seen that as the accuracy of the confidence interval is increased (up to 99%), the margins are more comprehensive because the probability of being confident in the location of the actual population value is increased. In other words, for a 95% confidence interval, there is a 5% probability of being wrong, but for a 99% interval, this probability is reduced to 1%. Consequently, the final interval must be wider to cover more values. The ME value indicates how much the calculated value will differ from the real value. When the confidence interval is increased to 99% (widening the range), the ME is naturally higher because the spread relative to the true mean is increased. To put it another way, the error will always grow instead of increasing the accuracy of the confidence interval, which is the necessary price to pay for getting more certainty: the higher the desired accuracy of locating the actual value, the higher the probability of being wrong."
"In his graphic novel, Spiegelman uses a literary device known as anthropomorphism to show the difference between races, including Americans, the Germans, and the Jews. This device makes the severe issue seem simpler to understand, and the readers pay more attention to the ideas expressed by the author. In Maus , Spiegelman portrays the horrors of the holocaust and reminds the readers that the holocaust’s victims and survivors also had their own lives and dreams.
The first section to be discussed is Chapter 1 – “The Sheik.” In this section, the main character Artie asks his father Vladek to tell him about his life during the war. Instead of describing the horrors Vladek faced during the holocaust, he prefers to tell his son about his happy and careless life in 1935 (Spiegelman, 1980, pp. 13-23). This desire to recall the good old days proves that the victims of the war prefer to remember the pleasant times.
The second section is Chapter 3- “Prisoner of War.” In this part of the novel, Vladek talks about the first events he witnessed as a soldier. Interestingly, Vladek remembers the name of a soldier he killed, and this detail shows that even during the terrible events, one’s brain catches the small and unmeaningful things (Spiegelman, 1980, p. 50). Finally, Vladek says that he was reunited with his family, and this event matters more than what he experienced as a prisoner of war.
The third part to analyze is Chapter 5 – “Mouse Holes.” This section shows that, for many mice, war is a series of difficult decisions that must be made in order for them to try to survive (Spiegelman, 1980). Even when parents learn about the death of their children, they need to keep a cold mind so as not to get caught by the cats.
To draw a conclusion, one may say that this graphic novel is a unique literary work about World War II. In these comic drawings, Spiegelman managed to portray the horrors of the holocaust and those little but meaningful things that supported the victims and helped some of them to remain hopeful. Despite the fact that the war was full of violence and murders, the author shows the irony of the situation – the Germans are just animals who imagine they are better than others."
"Epithelial tissues of the body represent the tissues lining the surfaces of skin, digestive organs, and respiratory organs. They can be found anywhere in the body where a barrier is needed to be formed, with things being able to pass across the created barrier. Because of the wide coverage of epithelial tissues in the body, there are many types of diseases affecting the tissue, and it is essential to know them to understand how the disease affects epithelial tissues. At this time, let’s focus on eczema as one of the widespread concerns of epithelial tissue.
Put simply, eczema also referred to as atopic dermatitis, is a condition that affects the skin, which is made of epithelial tissue1. It makes the skin red and itchy and can first manifest in people as early as childhood. It is important to note that eczema tends to transform into a chronic condition for many people and can disappear and flare up periodically, often depending on environmental factors. Unfortunately, there is no cure that can help clear eczema entirely and make it never reappear. Although, there are several treatments and self-care activities that can help relieve the itching and redness and prevent new flare-ups on a short-term basis. Examples of good practices for eczema include avoiding harsh soaps, moisturizing the skin on a regular basis, as well as applying medicated creams and different types of ointments.
Getting to know the symptoms of atopic dermatitis can help identify the signs early to engage in preventive and management efforts, according to a doctor’s recommendations. While the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis can vary from one person to another, they typically include dry skin, itching of different extents, especially during the night, the appearance of red to darker-colored patches, usually on the hands, feet, neck, ankles, wrists, as well as inside the knees and elbows’ bends. The skin affected by eczema usually appears thickened, scaly, and cracked, and due to scratching, it can often be raw, swollen, and highly sensitive to different external factors. Also, one may check for signs of small bumps that can leak fluid and crust over when being scratched.
When it comes to the age differentiation of eczema, the onset of the disease is often at five years old, with the highest incidence taking place between three and six months, but it can take place at any age. Around 60% of patients develop eczema in the first year of their life, while 90% get it within the first five years1. However, it is notable that atopic dermatitis can happen to people of different ages, although the percentage is much lower than those mentioned for children.
The burden of disease can be different depending on its severity as well as the ways of management. However, pain and itchiness of the skin can be quite cumbersome, preventing a person affected by eczema from doing everyday things2. Also, because eczema can often have an unpleasant appearance, some people can be self-conscious about it and get embarrassed, which is quite unfortunate3. Therefore, the problem with eczema is that it can significantly reduce the quality of life and health. Not only is sore and itchy skin annoying, but it also does not perform its protective function effectively, which causes a problem for the overall health of the body."
"The narrative structure in the movie Carol is distinct due to the focus on intricate elements of storytelling. The main reason for deviation from the traditional forms of the narrative approach is rooted in the fact that Carol provides a multitude of perspectives. The film does not solely revolve around Carol or Therese but rather smoothly transitions from one subplot to another. Both perspectives naturally merge into one cohesive and compelling story rich in information, emotion, and story elements.
Firstly, it is important to note that the given film’s setting takes place in the 1950s, when the world was significantly more conservative and restrictive, especially in regard to the members of the LGBTQ+ community. However, “it’s the way the decidedly modern sensibility of the narrative meets classic style that is the point” (Turan par. 4). In other words, the modern approach of utilizing several viewpoints on the story combined with classical stylistics makes the narrative structure unique and intricate. The film is shot in such a way that viewers regularly become mere observers of the characters, who convey their emotional states not through words but rather through facial expressions, settings, postures, and musical backgrounds. Another review states that viewers watch “the characters through the windows of a car or house and left them in a hazy focus” (Raynes par. 8). At various points in the film, viewers can observe the protagonists sitting or standing behind windows, resembling the realistic experience since it is usually how people see strangers rather than being part of private conversations.
Secondly, the narrative structure differentiates itself from the traditional techniques due to attentive and up-close gamesmanship. A film reviewer cleverly points out one of Haynes’s statements, where he wanted to have a unique narrative structure, and thus stated: “I felt like if we followed a genre very closely, but did it with dolls, and did it very carefully and very lovingly and attentively, it could stimulate emotions in a viewer the way it would if it was actors” (Barr par. 2). In other words, there is an intentional effort to follow the story, gradually spiraling from one character to another without any rigid transitions. Therefore, the film’s narrative puts a great deal of emphasis on non-verbal communication because it wants to keep conversations and interactions as realistic as possible.
However, the emotional elements and key aspects of the characters’ exchanges are delivered through gazing, staring, smiles, and other forms of expression. Under the conditions of such a narrative, the role of a judge is assumed not by the director, producer, or scriptwriter but by the viewer, and moreover, not by an individual viewer but by the audience. If the audience is captivated by the cinematic image, emotions and feelings awakened in it, then the filmmaker has successfully completed the task. In other words, in Carol’s narrative structure, the delivery of meaning and essence is carried out through the captivating followership of the protagonists.
In conclusion, the selected movie’s narrative differs from the traditional forms due to the use of several perspectives from which protagonists can be met and observed. The transitions between one subplot to another are intricately smooth, which ensures the cohesiveness of one singular story. The film does not try to explain but rather shows in its natural setting without excessive invasiveness from a viewer’s perspective."
"In Donna Woodfolk Cross's article, ""Propaganda: How Not to Be Bamboozled,"" she argues that propaganda is neither inherently good nor bad, but rather a tool that can be exploited for various purposes. Cross effectively highlights different fallacies and demagoguery techniques by providing examples throughout her article. One notable fallacy she illustrates is the association fallacy, which subtly sways readers' opinions.
The implementation of an association fallacy is evident when Cross uses examples predominantly from right-wing talking points. By showcasing only one side of the political spectrum, the article lacks representation for opposing viewpoints, raising concerns about bias. This lack of diverse examples undermines the article's intention to expose propaganda, as it inadvertently becomes a tool for propaganda itself.
Despite the irony of the article's intention, Cross skillfully presents various techniques used in propaganda. She highlights fallacies, such as ad hominem attacks and appeal to fear, to demonstrate their persuasive power. By analyzing these techniques in detail, Cross forces readers to critically evaluate their beliefs and the propaganda they encounter in everyday life.
Overall, Cross's article effectively analyzes the use of propaganda by illustrating different fallacies and demagoguery techniques. However, the implementation of an association fallacy and the lack of representation for opposing viewpoints compromise the article's credibility and inadvertently turn it into a propaganda tool. Nonetheless, the article successfully exposes the power and manipulation behind propaganda, encouraging readers to be aware and vigilant in their consumption of information."
"Reading Emily Dickinson’s poems is one of the most captivating and challenging tasks for many students. On the one hand, she raises a variety of interesting themes that fulfill human life and motivate in her short poems. On the other hand, the combination of oddness and restraint confuses. There are twelve lines in her “I Died for Beauty,” but each sentence delivers a message about the poet’s interests and literary contributions. Inevitability, life-long goals, and conflict are the three themes in Dickinson’s poem that are properly conveyed through the imagery of truth and beauty.
Death is the only thing that remains inevitable in human life despite multiple intentions to avoid or postpone it by a variety of means. Dickinson introduces two speakers who died because of different reasons but similarly “adjusted in the tomb… in an adjoining room” (lines 2, 4). The poet uses such a terrible but expected end when a person leaves this world to underline humans’ equality before nature and the fact that death ends most people’s capacities to speak, wish, or act (Dahami 256). There is no need to consider achievement, knowledge, or wealth because the outcome, an empty grave, is the same for everyone.
Another significant aspect of the poem is the identification of life-long goals and possibilities. According to Dickinson, people may die with two thoughts in mind, either for beauty or truth (lines 6-7). These two concepts are so different and similar at the same time, proving her constant struggle for spiritual victory (Sharma 103). The conversation between the supporters of truth and beauty is not a debate but a contribution to Dickinson’s maturity in understanding the essence of life and the correctness of death. These two metaphors divide society into two groups who may strive for something realistic and cherished, like beauty, or search for something incomprehensible but vital, like truth. The poem shows that people are free to set and choose different goals during their lives, focusing on their interests and wants.
Finally, in her simple and unobtrusive dialogue, Dickinson seems to be bothered with the conditions that cause conflict in interpersonal relationships. There is no need to have a real opponent to be in conflict. However, the controversy between the existing forms and substance is evident in her poem (Sharma 103). Human life needs conflicts to be complete and fair, and the author helps the reader recognize the roots of questions and differences. One speaker dies for beauty but learns that it is scarce, and another speaker admires the possibility to die for truth but sees that it does not change faith. The same end and the same emptiness “covered up our names,” without giving a chance to protect and immortalize the identity (Dickinson line 12). Although this poem is not about conflict, this theme strengthens an understanding of the story.
Dickinson succeeds in using several powerful techniques and terms to demonstrate how poetry should penetrate the human mind. Her “I Died for Beauty” is not just a conversation between two persons who lived and died but a combination of hope, knowledge, and outcome. This close reading is a chance to see how Dickinson treated life and accepted death through the prism of personal goals and entire conflicts. Inevitability is never univocal, and it is a responsibility of people to live and learn and be ready for death not because of something purposeful but for something eternal."

"Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by airway inflammation, airflow obstruction, and increased airway responsiveness. It affects millions of individuals worldwide and can have a significant impact on the quality of life. In this essay, we will discuss the pathophysiology and manifestation of asthma, including the primary organ affected and the physiological processes involved. We will also explore the common symptoms and signs of asthma and the importance of identifying different asthma zones.
The primary organ affected in asthma is the respiratory system, specifically the bronchial tubes. These tubes, responsible for carrying air in and out of the lungs, become inflamed and narrowed in individuals with asthma. This inflammation is triggered by exposure to various allergens, irritants, or infections.
The pathophysiology of asthma involves a complex interplay of various immune cells and mediators. When exposed to an allergen or irritant, such as pollen or dust mites, mast cells in the airways release inflammatory substances, such as histamine and leukotrienes. These substances cause bronchoconstriction, increased mucus production, and edema of the airway walls. Additionally, T-helper cells release cytokines, leading to further inflammation and the recruitment of eosinophils, neutrophils, and other immune cells to the airways. The presence of these cells perpetuates the inflammatory response and contributes to airway remodeling over time.
One of the key physiological processes involved in asthma is airflow obstruction. The narrowed airways, combined with increased mucus production and edema, impede the smooth flow of air in and out of the lungs. This obstruction leads to symptoms such as wheezing, breathlessness, and coughing. Furthermore, as the obstruction worsens during an asthma attack, the patient may experience increased work of breathing, chest tightness, and reduced exercise tolerance.
Identifying different asthma zones is essential for effective management and treatment. The three commonly recognized asthma zones are green, yellow, and red, which correspond to well-controlled, partially controlled, and poorly controlled asthma, respectively. These zones help guide medication adjustment and interventions based on an individual's symptoms and lung function.
In the green zone, the individual experiences minimal symptoms, has normal lung function, and can perform daily activities without limitation. They are typically using their controller medication regularly and have a written asthma action plan in place. It is crucial to recognize the importance of maintaining this zone to prevent exacerbations and maintain good asthma control.
In the yellow zone, the individual may experience increased symptoms, such as coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath. Lung function may also be moderately reduced. This zone indicates that asthma control is deteriorating, and prompt action is needed. The patient should increase their reliever medication, monitor their symptoms closely, and follow their written action plan. Failure to address symptoms in this zone could lead to progression to the red zone.
The red zone represents a severe exacerbation or poorly controlled asthma. Symptoms are often severe and persistent, and lung function is significantly compromised. Medical intervention, including emergency treatment, may be required. It is vital for individuals with asthma to seek immediate medical attention if they find themselves in this zone to avoid life-threatening complications.
In conclusion, asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by airway inflammation, obstruction, and increased airway responsiveness. It primarily affects the bronchial tubes and involves a complex interplay of immune cells and mediators. Symptoms include wheezing, breathlessness, and coughing, which can vary in severity depending on the asthma zone. Understanding these zones and promptly taking appropriate action is crucial for effective management and maintaining good asthma control. Regular monitoring, adherence to medication, and having a written action plan are vital components in managing and living with asthma."
"Introduction (100 words):
In the modern world, individuals are regularly faced with making decisions about healthcare services among various consumer purchases. This essay aims to explore the key factors that should be considered when choosing healthcare services in comparison to other consumer purchases. While consumer purchases involve evaluating quality, cost, and personal preferences, healthcare decisions require additional considerations, such as urgency, expertise, and ethical implications. By analyzing these factors, individuals can make informed decisions about their healthcare needs, ensuring their well-being and overall satisfaction.
Body:
1. Quality of Service (100 words):
One of the primary factors to consider when deciding on healthcare services compared to other consumer purchases is the quality of service provided. Depending on the specific context, quality may encompass various aspects, including the competence of healthcare professionals, facility cleanliness, advanced technology, and patient safety. Unlike ordinary consumer purchases, healthcare services directly impact individuals' well-being, making it crucial to seek out reputable providers, read reviews, and inquire about certifications before committing to any healthcare service.
2. Cost and Financial Considerations (100 words):
While cost is a significant factor in both healthcare and other consumer purchases, healthcare services usually come with distinct financial considerations. The cost of healthcare services often entails insurance coverage, deductibles, copayments, or potential out-of-pocket expenses. Unlike the immediate satisfaction gained from traditional consumer purchases, healthcare expenses might have long-term financial repercussions. Thus, considering the affordability, insurance coverage, and potential future healthcare needs play a crucial role in making sound decisions about healthcare services.
3. Urgency and Timing (100 words):
Healthcare decisions often involve the element of urgency and timing, which sets them apart from other consumer purchases. In emergency situations or instances requiring immediate attention, the decision-making process becomes time-sensitive. Conversely, non-urgent medical needs may allow more research, comparison, and consultation. Recognizing the urgency or priority level of healthcare requirements must be taken into account to ensure timely access to appropriate healthcare services.
4. Expertise and Specialization (100 words):
Choosing healthcare services also necessitates evaluating the expertise and specialization of healthcare professionals. Unlike other consumer purchases, healthcare decisions involve entrusting one's health to professionals who possess specific knowledge and skills. Factors such as healthcare provider reputation, specialization, experience, and patient outcomes play a crucial role. Seeking recommendations, examining credentials, and inquiring about specialists' specific areas of expertise can assist in making informed healthcare decisions.
5. Ethical Considerations (100 words):
Ethical implications are another vital aspect that differentiates healthcare services from other consumer purchases. Healthcare inherently deals with matters of well-being, safety, and life itself. Decisions related to healthcare services often involve ethical dilemmas such as allocation of resources, prioritization of patients, informed consent, or end-of-life care. Considering personal values and ethical principles, such as justice, autonomy, and beneficence, becomes important when making healthcare decisions. Reflecting on these ethical considerations helps ensure that personal values align with the choices made, promoting patient satisfaction and ethical healthcare practices.
Conclusion (100 words):
In conclusion, making decisions about healthcare services compared to other consumer purchases involves considering a unique set of factors. The quality of service, financial considerations, urgency, expertise, and ethical implications have profound effects on the outcomes of healthcare choices. While consumer purchases focus on personal preferences, healthcare decisions require additional attention to the potential impact on well-being, the competency of providers, and ethical responsibilities. By comprehensively evaluating these factors, individuals can make well-informed decisions about their healthcare needs, thus ensuring optimal health outcomes and overall satisfaction."

"Introduction:
The opioid crisis sweeping the United States has reached epidemic proportions, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake. In this essay, we will delve into the causes, effects, and available forms of treatment for those suffering from opioid addiction. Additionally, we will analyze the effectiveness of substitution therapy and the crucial role of family support in aiding a friend or family member facing opioid addiction.
Causes of the Opioid Crisis:
The origins of the crisis can be traced back to the overprescribing of pain medication. Pharmaceutical companies aggressively marketed opioids, downplayed their addictive nature, and misled medical professionals regarding their potential risks. Consequently, doctors began prescribing opioids at alarming rates for chronic pain, inadvertently fueling addiction among patients.
Effects of the Opioid Crisis:
The effects of the opioid crisis have been devastating across all aspects of American society. Thousands of lives have been lost to overdoses, leaving families shattered and communities in mourning. Furthermore, opioid addiction has strained medical resources, overwhelmed treatment centers, and put immense pressure on already burdened emergency services. Economically, the cost of treating opioid addiction and its associated consequences has skyrocketed, reaching billions of dollars annually.
Available Forms of Treatment:
In responding to the opioid crisis, a multifaceted approach is crucial. The first step in treatment is often detoxification, clearing the body of opioids. However, because of the intense withdrawal symptoms, relapse is common. This is where substitution therapy, such as medication-assisted treatment (MAT), plays a significant role. MAT involves the use of medications like methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone, which reduce cravings and ease withdrawal symptoms. Combining medication with counseling and behavioral therapies has proven to be highly effective in promoting long-term recovery.
Effectiveness of Substitution Therapy:
Substitution therapy, particularly medication-assisted treatment, has shown remarkable success rates in mitigating the harmful effects of opioid addiction. These medications stabilize brain chemistry, allowing individuals to regain control over their lives. Studies have consistently shown that individuals on MAT are more likely to remain in treatment, reduce illicit drug use, decrease criminal activity, and lower the risk of fatal overdose.
Importance of Family Support:
Family support plays a vital role in aiding a friend or family member grappling with opioid addiction. It provides a supportive environment that combats isolation and encourages treatment-seeking behavior. Families can participate in support groups, educate themselves about addiction, and create a network of understanding individuals ready to offer guidance and encouragement. Research suggests that family support significantly increases the likelihood of positive outcomes in recovery, reinforcing the importance of fostering a strong familial network.
Conclusion:
The opioid crisis in the United States necessitates urgent action and compassion. By understanding the causes and effects of this crisis, we can better address the issue at hand. Substitution therapy, particularly medication-assisted treatment, has proven its effectiveness in helping individuals overcome opioid addiction. Additionally, family support plays a critical role in providing a nurturing environment conducive to recovery. Awareness, education, and policy reform are essential in combatting the opioid crisis and ensuring brighter futures for those affected."
"Health promoters are a trained workforce whose primary purpose is to improve health through a variety of activities carried out by health promotion organizations. Individual empowerment, societal responsibility for health, and establishing an enabling environment for developing personal skills and boosting community action are among their top goals (Nutbeam, 2019). In the realm of health promotion, experts from various multidisciplinary health workers have agreed on the characteristics of effective collaboration and an interdisciplinary approach.
Interdisciplinary teams’ most essential purpose is to bring together a variety of diverse viewpoints on caring and to use the talents and knowledge of many different individuals and sectors. Intersectional collaboration between different health professionals and the public and commercial sectors is critical for effective health promotion (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2018). The diversity of these elements demonstrates that one’s health is not just dependent on medical services or nurses and physicians (Nutbeam, 2019). The large range of activities that make up health promotion needs a diverse set of abilities from a number of health professionals and industries.
Incorporating multidisciplinary specialists within the health promotion team, such as Nurse Practitioners (NPs), Social Workers (SWs), and Registered Nurses (RNs), will be advantageous in the long and short term. Nurse practitioners are nurses who receive further education and training and are capable of treating a wide range of ailments as well as providing preventative care and health education (Pun, 2018). Social workers have specialized training in assisting people and groups in developing skills and resolving difficulties. Whether the issues are personal, interpersonal, or social in nature, social workers can assist in guiding and resolving many of today’s issues (Nutbeam, 2019). Registered nurses examine and analyze healthcare needs in order to decide the best service or treatment, the best healthcare provider, and the best equipment to deliver patient care (Pun, 2018). Thus, their skills and approach will be essential in the success of an interdisciplinary team tasked with health promotion."
"Introduction:
Democracy, as a political system, has transformed significantly over the centuries, with modern democracies showcasing major advancements in inclusivity and representative governance compared to ancient Athens. In this essay, we will explore the key differences in eligibility to vote and the shift from direct to representative democracy, understanding the progressive nature of contemporary democratic systems.
Body:
1. Eligibility to Vote:
Ancient Athens:
In ancient Athenian democracy, voting rights were exclusive to a limited subset of citizens. Only free adult male citizens who had completed military training and both their parents were Athenian citizens were granted voting rights. This narrow definition of citizenship excluded women, slaves, foreigners, and metics, leading to significant disenfranchisement and a lack of inclusivity.
Modern Democracies:
In stark contrast, modern democracies have made considerable strides in expanding the franchise to ensure inclusivity. Universal suffrage has become a fundamental principle in most democratic nations, guaranteeing voting rights to all citizens, regardless of gender, race, or social status. This has allowed democracies to reflect the diverse needs and aspirations of contemporary societies and promote equal participation and representation.
2. Shift from Direct to Representative Democracy:
Ancient Athens:
Athens embraced a direct democratic model where all eligible citizens directly participated in decision-making. Legislative proposals were introduced, debated, and voted on by all citizens in the assembly, known as the Ecclesia. While this system demonstrated a high degree of citizen participation, it was constrained by practical limitations, as only a small portion of the population could physically gather and deliberate on matters.
Modern Democracies:
Recognizing the challenges of direct democracy, modern democracies have evolved to adopt a system of representative democracy. In this model, citizens elect representatives who act on their behalf and make decisions in legislative bodies. Representative democracy allows for wider participation, as people exercise their democratic rights through electing officials, who are accountable to the electorate. This system streamlines decision-making, ensures wider representation of diverse voices, and allows citizens to focus on other aspects of life while trusting their representatives to act in their best interests.
3. Advancements in Democratic Participation:
Ancient Athens:
Political participation in ancient Athens was limited to relatively small numbers of citizens who had the time and resources to actively engage in civic matters. This prevented a substantial percentage of the population from influencing policy decisions, resulting in an exclusionary political system.
Modern Democracies:
Modern democracies actively strive to create opportunities for broader citizen participation. Various mechanisms such as town hall meetings, public consultations, and digital platforms enable citizens to voice their concerns, contribute to policy-making, and hold elected officials accountable. Additionally, modern democracies offer multiple pathways for citizens to engage in political processes, such as joining political parties, advocating for causes, and running for office. This inclusive approach ensures that diverse perspectives and ideas are incorporated into policy decisions, fostering a more representative and participatory democracy.
Conclusion:
Modern democracies have made remarkable advancements in inclusivity and representation, contrasting sharply with the limitations and exclusions inherent in ancient Athenian democracy. By expanding voting rights, adopting representative models, and improving democratic participation, contemporary societies have created systems that better reflect the diverse needs and aspirations of their citizenry. However, there is always room for improvement, as democracies continue to evolve to ensure better inclusivity, representation, and engagement of all individuals in the political process."
"There is a growing number of physicians’ encounters with the victims of human trafficking, sometimes even without recognizing them as such. Recently, Todres (2017) reported an incident, where Dr. W was requested to screen the women-employees of such a firm for sexually transmitted infections. On the one hand, according to the Code of Medical Ethics of the American Medical Association (2011), it is necessary to safeguard patient confidentiality, including several aspects, such as physical, informational, decisional, and associational privacy. At the same time, it is obligatory to keep the records of all the patients in the healthcare settings while Dr. W was asked not to maintain them to avoid possible arrest of these women. Thus, the doctor understood that in another case, the employees of this firm would not have a chance for diligent healthcare and, moreover, could possibly spread the STIs further.
The case engages issues in several fields, such as criminal law, ethical concerns, human rights, and service provider regulations. From the side of conspiracy law, it is possible to assume that the agreement of Dr. W is equal to the participation in the crime. As she is aware of the crime and did not report it but helped in its realization, the court’s decision can be not in her favor. From the point of view of human rights, prostitution is illegal in the US. Even more, if the minors are employed in the firm, the case falls under the mandatory reported law (Todres, 2016). Ethical considerations here also imply helping a child by breaching confidentiality.
To conclude, the decision in the case of an encounter with human trafficking should be equivocal. By facilitating the activity of an enterprise engaged with human trafficking, a physician is partly responsible for the crimes and exploitation of women and children. Therefore, following the legal frameworks and ethical considerations, such cases should be reported."
"Dreaming is an exciting and still inexplicable human experience that occurs entirely in one’s brain during sleeping. Before taking this course, I was skeptical about the value of dreams. Indeed, I was influenced mainly by the studies that explained this phenomenon from the point of continuous activity of people’s minds that processes daily routine during the night. However, after studying various sources about our visions during sleep, I understood the reasoning behind less scientific explanations. This class allowed me to be more attentive to dreams to understand my emotional problems and helped me learn about the causes of students’ nightmares.
The new information that interested me was the dreaming experiences of Jordanian students that were similar to their counterparts from Western countries. It was unusual to learn from this chapter by Nasser & Bulkeley (2009) that negative dreams were recalled and reported more frequently. Most of the participants’ nightmares had some association with their daily concerns. Dreaming about elements of the supernatural world, like jinn, was the reflection of these individuals’ cultural and religious beliefs (Nasser & Bulkeley, 2009). Even though it is logical to think that people’s habits and thoughts would appear in their dreams, it was still fascinating to read how their brains were able to reconstruct these ideas into realistic images. I used to dream about book and movie characters, but I only recently admitted that my mind could create imaginary scenarios involving me in these fictional stories. Analyzing my behavior in these nightmares revealed that I isolated myself from my friends and became lonely in dreams. Indeed, I realized that our brains might generate visions to prepare us for similar challenges in the future.
The prophetic dreams of some people remain a mystery, and I am less skeptical about these cases after reading Icelandic stories. Specifically, the article by Heijnen (2005) made me alter my viewpoint about dreaming. Before enrolling in this course, I could relate to those Icelanders, mentioned in the paper by Heijnen (2005), who “qualify dreams as personal fantasies not worth much pondering upon” (p. 194). Although I did not become superstitious about nightmares after reading this manuscript, I started to be more careful about the psychology behind episodes that my friends or I may see while asleep.
There is no certainty in the authenticity of the stories presented in the article, but many real-world examples of similar dreaming experiences exist today. Indeed, as I discovered later, the stories of people talking to the dead or preventing some catastrophic events are not unique to Iceland’s ancient culture. Many of my relatives told me about their conversations with their deceased partners or parents. However, I cannot accept the idea of Icelanders that dreams are given from the external world rather than generated in our brains (Heijnen, 2005). Nevertheless, this manuscript helped me realize that science still cannot explain many events and behaviors; thus, I should remain open to various theories about human mental potential.
In summary, this course about dreaming helped me learn various opinions about this brain activity. I used to view dreams as processing information and experiences of our daily lives. In fact, it is partly true because studies demonstrated that people dreamed about the same concerns but mainly in a negative sense, which might be explained by cultural constraints and anticipation of a bad outcome. The most puzzling components of this phenomenon are people’s nightmares about the supernatural world that are probably caused by individuals’ beliefs, accentuated by their imagination. These elements are not universal across the globe, and thus it is hard to apply psychoanalytic principles to explain such visions. Overall, I think that this part of human life requires more research that should involve professionals in both scientific and non-scientific fields."
"Arguably, profit and cash flow differ because profit is considered an amount that a business entity is left with after settling all the firm’s expenses. Contrary, cash flow is an aggregate net flow in the form of cash both into the business and out of the business operations. Therefore, cash flow is considered as attainable operational balance and conclusive monetary coverage (Sitompul & Khadijah, 2020). While cash flow existence can occur without necessarily a firm gaining a profit, the existence of profit is only estimated after a positive balance of trade. It is believable that the firm’s cash flow and profit are essential aspects. For instance, understanding both will allow the company manager to gauge the firm’s operational capabilities while ensuring that the business can stand on its feet in terms of paying for its expenses. Additionally, while profit indicates positive returns to the company, cash flow indicates positive operations that contribute to desirable business decisions.
As a technology manager, I would be keeping an eye on innovation and incorporating the same into operation while focusing on the cost factor. According to Elia et al. (2021), the cost factor is the main aspect to focus on when a firm needs to be innovative. For instance, cost consideration is critical as it will minimize resulting friction from the extended cost that might jeopardize entire operations. Cost consideration will be my major aspect to focus on in my venture."

"Credible evidence serves as the foundation for effective patient care decisions. Healthcare professionals must rely on scientific studies, data, and peer-reviewed research to gather evidence that supports their clinical judgments. By using credible evidence, healthcare professionals can ensure that their decisions are evidence-based and have a higher chance of leading to positive patient outcomes. Furthermore, the use of credible evidence promotes transparency and accountability, as it allows patients and their families to understand the rationale behind the decisions made regarding their care.
Frequency-based reasoning is another essential aspect of patient care decisions. By considering the prevalence and probability of different outcomes, healthcare professionals can make decisions that are tailored to the individual patient's needs. For example, when deciding on a treatment plan, a healthcare provider may consider the success rates and potential side effects associated with different interventions. By analyzing these probabilities, they can make a more informed decision that balances potential benefits and risks, ultimately leading to better patient care.
However, it is crucial to evaluate reasoning standards in both scientific and ethical contexts to ensure the highest quality of patient care. In the scientific context, healthcare professionals must critically evaluate the validity and reliability of the evidence they utilize. This involves examining the study design, sample size, statistical significance, and conflicts of interest to ensure that the evidence is trustworthy and applicable to the patient's specific situation.
In the ethical context, healthcare professionals must consider the patient's values, preferences, and autonomy when making decisions. Evaluating reasoning standards ethically involves respecting patient autonomy, maintaining confidentiality, and avoiding any conflicts of interest that may compromise the patient's best interest. The ethical evaluation of reasoning standards ensures that decisions are made in a patient-centered manner and with utmost integrity.
In conclusion, reasoning is of great significance in patient care decisions. The use of credible evidence and frequency-based reasoning enables healthcare professionals to make informed choices, leading to improved patient outcomes. Moreover, evaluating reasoning standards in both scientific and ethical contexts ensures that decisions are based on reliable evidence and align with the patient's values and preferences. By prioritizing reasoning in patient care, healthcare professionals can provide the highest quality of care to their patients."
"Confidence limits and hypothesis testing are some of the key components of statistical testing that are used in healthcare administration for different purposes. Both of them are interconnected, as it is impossible to establish a hypothesis without knowing the confidence limits. The numbers indicate the lower and the upper ends of the confidence interval (Kros & Rosenthal, 2016). For instance, if a man is six and the confidence limits are 4 and 7, the confidence interval will be 4 to 7. They indicate how accurate an estimate of the mean will be for a particular statistical category of objects or characteristics. Confidence limits enable medical personnel or healthcare administrators to establish how close the estimate they have is likely to be to the one that exists. In order to count the confidence limits for a particular object, one needs to calculate a confidence interval.
Hypothesis testing helps establish whether a particular statement or hypothesis is true and determines how plausible it is. In order to find it out, the statists usually use sample data from a particular population, relying on the characteristics they need. The hypothesis is divided into two large groups. The first one is called the null hypothesis, and it is a statement that indicates that there is no statistical difference between two or more variables (Kros & Rosenthal, 2016). The second type is the alternative hypothesis, and which is opposed to the null hypothesis and is what statists usually check.
When speaking about hypothesis testing, it is necessary to mention the two types of errors healthcare assistants may face while trying to establish the validity and relevance of a particular statement. The error of the first type is also called a False Negative. It may appear when a statistical analysis concludes that the null hypothesis is false and irrelevant when, in fact, it is true (Kros & Rosenthal, 2016). The second type of error is called False Positive, and, unlike in the case of the errors of the first type, they conclude that the null hypothesis is true when in reality, it is false.
Hypothesis testing alongside the confidence intervals is the two most important constituents of the research methodology in all types of research, including medical ones. They serve as guidelines in planning, realizing, and establishing the final results during the process of conducting a study. If the healthcare providers do not understand these two methods and do not pay attention to the statistical and clinical differences, they may be unable to establish the right diagnosis for a patient (Williams & Wan, 2016). It is necessary to remember that all doctors may be considered God’s missionaries who have the skills and knowledge to treat them ( English Standard Version Bible , 2001, Luca 9:1). However, they will not be able to prescribe adequate treatment for the patients without the right diagnosis. Despite the significance of the methods mentioned above, it is necessary to rely on quantitative studies as well, as their usage may give a broader outlook on the disease (Pope et al., 2002). Hence, doctors should not consider confidence limits and hypothesis testing as the only medical research methods.
Taking into account all mentioned above, it is possible to conclude that hypothesis testing and confidence intervals are connected with each other. Both of them belong to the category of inferential techniques, and they use samples in order to either estimate a characteristic of a particular population or check the validity of a statement. Hence, confidence intervals and confidence limits, in particular, are used to estimate sampling parameters, while hypothesis testing is a method that shows whether the hypothesis is reliable or not. Both these methods can be used either in tandem or separately in order to help healthcare assistants support their conclusions or establish the relevance of particular suppositions."
"Healthcare leaders play a critical role in adapting to external changes and strategically communicating with their coworkers to improve patient care. The constant evolution of the healthcare industry, coupled with the need for effective teamwork and communication, necessitates leaders who are adaptable and possess strong communication skills.

By creating an environment where change is seen as a positive force, healthcare leaders can inspire their coworkers to embrace external changes and find innovative ways to enhance patient care.
Strategic communication is another essential aspect of effective healthcare leadership. Leaders should prioritize clear and transparent communication to ensure that everyone in the organization is working towards the same goal – providing the best possible patient care. Regular team meetings, emails, and newsletters can serve as platforms for healthcare leaders to disseminate information, share updates, and address any concerns or issues.
Moreover, healthcare leaders should actively listen to their coworkers and encourage their input and feedback. By creating opportunities for open dialogue and active involvement, leaders can tap into the collective knowledge and experiences of their team members. This promotes a sense of ownership and engagement, motivating coworkers to contribute their ideas and suggestions for improving patient care.
Collaboration is another vital element of strategic communication in healthcare leadership. Leaders should facilitate collaboration between different departments, ensuring that all stakeholders work together seamlessly to provide comprehensive and holistic patient care. This can be achieved through interdisciplinary team meetings, joint projects, and the use of collaborative platforms that facilitate information sharing and communication.
In conclusion, healthcare leaders must adapt to external changes and employ strategic communication strategies to enhance patient care. By staying informed, fostering adaptability, and encouraging open dialogue, leaders can effectively navigate the ever-evolving healthcare landscape.

"Introduction:
In his influential book ""Bowling Alone,"" Robert Putnam delves into the concept of social capital and its profound implications for democratic societies. This essay aims to analyze the concept of social capital and its significance in democratic societies while focusing on the causes and consequences of the decline in social capital in the United States since the mid-to-late-1960s. Additionally, potential solutions for re-establishing social capital in contemporary society, considering the distinction between bridging and bonding social capital and the associated limitations or risks, will be explored.
Understanding Social Capital:
Social capital refers to the social connections, trust, norms, and collective values within a community or society that enable individuals to cooperate effectively for mutual benefit. It encompasses both ""bonding"" social capital, which strengthens relationships within a particular group, and ""bridging"" social capital, which fosters connections between diverse groups and promotes societal cohesion.
Causes of Declining Social Capital:
1. Technological Advances: The rise of television, internet, and other entertainment mediums since the mid-20th century has contributed to the decline in social capital. Individuals spend more time consuming media, leading to reduced face-to-face interaction and a decrease in community engagement.
2. Urbanization and Suburbanization: As people migrated to cities and suburbs, the sense of community and social cohesion diminished. The physical distance between individuals, combined with longer commutes and decreased public spaces, hindered social interaction.
3. Changing Family Structure: The shift from extended families to nuclear families resulted in decreased intergenerational ties. As a consequence, traditional social networks that fostered community engagement eroded.
4. Political Polarization: Growing political polarization in the United States has led to increased social segregation. Individuals tend to associate with people who hold similar beliefs, weakening social ties across divergent groups and impairing social capital.
Consequences of Declining Social Capital:
The declining social capital in the United States has far-reaching consequences:
1. Weakened Civic Engagement: Reduced participation in community organizations, volunteerism, and political activities hampers the functioning of democratic institutions and diminishes citizens' ability to influence policy decisions.
2. Diminished Trust: Declining social capital erodes trust between individuals and institutions, hindering cooperation and collaborative problem-solving.
3. Inequality: Social capital facilitates upward social mobility by providing networks and resources. Its decline exacerbates existing social and economic inequalities, hindering collective progress.
Re-establishing Social Capital:
1. Promote Community Engagement: Encouraging grassroots initiatives such as neighborhood associations, community events, and local volunteering fosters bonding social capital and strengthens communities.
2. Create Shared Public Spaces: Investing in public spaces like parks, libraries, and community centers can foster interactions and serve as gathering places for diverse groups, promoting bridging social capital.
3. Foster Inclusive Education: Schools can play a critical role in cultivating social connections and democratic values. Implementing curricula that emphasize teamwork, cooperation, and civic engagement can rebuild social capital among youth.
4. Leverage Technology Thoughtfully: Utilizing technology to facilitate connections and community-building, such as online platforms that connect individuals based on shared interests or local initiatives, can promote social capital without completely replacing face-to-face interactions.
Limitations and Risks:
1. Potential Exclusion: While social capital holds the potential to foster cooperation, it can inadvertently exclude those without access to social networks or marginalized groups. Efforts must be made to ensure inclusivity and account for existing power imbalances.
2. Ethical Concerns: Building social capital should not come at the expense of privacy or autonomy. Safeguarding personal data and maintaining ethical standards in the digital realm is crucial.
3. Substituting Social Capital for Institutions: Relying excessively on social capital may result in neglecting the role of strong institutions in promoting a fair and just society. Balancing the advantages of social capital with robust institutional frameworks is essential.
Conclusion:
As the United States grapples with the decline in social capital, recognizing the significance of this concept in reinforcing democratic societies becomes imperative. Understanding the causes and consequences of its decline allows us to explore potential solutions while considering the distinct roles of bonding and bridging social capital. By fostering community engagement, investing in public spaces, promoting inclusive education, and thoughtfully leveraging technology, we can rebuild social capital and lay the foundations for a stronger and more cohesive democratic society.

"Ancient Rome could be described as multicultural, largely due to the significant areas of land that the Roman Empire controlled at various points, often integrating the local populations and cultures into their own. A wide variety of cultures existed within the borders of the Roman civilization and the Roman population was found to have incredible genetic diversity, having more in common with the Mediterranean states rather than Western Europe (Thomsen, 2019). Some of the cultures that were present under Roman rule include the Gauls, Greeks, Syrian, Egyptian, Lebanese, Persia, and many others. Scholars attribute the cultural and economic success of Rome partially to its ability to embrace a range of ethnic and national identities, often assimilating many elements of the foreign cultures into its own traditions, beliefs or practices.
The well-known Pax Romana , a period of prosperity and tranquility for approximately 200 years came at a point when Roman conquests came to a relative end, and a range of cultures were given the opportunity to live in harmony under one central government. While as all Empires, Rome did push some values and requirements upon the regions it conquered, for the most part, the people could live their lives, worship their respective religions, follow their respective traditions, and even maintain their own laws and taxation (Brooks, 2019). Rome by far was one of the most multicultural states in the ancient world that greatly respected the civilizations of others.
The primary culture that strongly influenced the Roman culture is likely Ancient Greece. The Hellenistic society led the basis to much what is Roman, ranging from architecture to art to philosophy and politics. The Romans greatly respected the Greeks for their progress and intelligence, and sought to build upon that foundation in the prosperity of their empire including in the aspects of science, literature, law, economics, and even military tactics. Furthermore, the Romans were influenced by the Etruscans, a neighboring tribe to the northwest of Rome, who were allied with and then conquering the newly formed city-state. Etruscans were heavy traders with the Greeks, and had a similarly loose empire of city states, sharing many of the cultural elements. Essentially, the Etruscans allowed for the Greek culture to transition into Rome (Brooks, 2019). However, Rome was influenced by the Etruscans in its early days by contributing to its military capabilities and war-oriented, expansionist society."

"Introduction:
The issue of whether Confederate statues should be removed or preserved as historical symbols is a contentious topic that has garnered significant attention in recent years. This essay aims to present a balanced view by discussing the arguments for and against the preservation of Confederate statues as well as providing personal perspectives on this complex issue.
Arguments for the preservation of Confederate statues:
Proponents of preserving Confederate statues argue that they serve as tangible reminders of our nation's troubled past, providing historical lessons and context. They contend that removing these statues erases an integral aspect of our history, hindering opportunities for reflection and education. Preserving these monuments may encourage dialogue about the nation's racial divide, reinforcing the importance of progress and inclusivity.
Furthermore, some assert that Confederate statues can be seen as symbols of Southern heritage and regional pride, devoid of support for the reprehensible ideology they once represented. These individuals advocate for contextualizing these statues with plaques or educational exhibits, providing historical explanations and encouraging critical thinking.
Arguments against the preservation of Confederate statues:
Opponents argue that Confederate statues glorify a painful era marked by slavery, oppression, and racism. They stress that these statues often pay tribute to Confederate leaders who fought to preserve an institution tragically built on the dehumanization of millions. To these critics, the presence of these statues perpetuates racial inequality and constrains the progress needed for societal healing.
Moreover, the association of Confederate statues with alt-right movements and white supremacist ideologies has further fueled the demand for removal. Detractors contend that these statues serve as rallying points for hate groups and contribute to a culture of racial intolerance.
Personal perspective:
While recognizing the historical importance of preserving certain Confederate statues, I believe that the decision should be made on a case-by-case basis, considering the specific context and impact of each statue on the community. Statues glorifying individuals who actively propagated racism and oppression should be reevaluated for removal. However, statues with historical significance, aptly contextualized, can serve as tangible reminders of our dark past while promoting open discussions on systemic racism.
Conclusion:
The discussion surrounding the preservation of Confederate statues evokes intense emotions due to the painful history they represent. Striking a balance between historical preservation and the demands for social progress necessitates careful consideration and contextualization. Ultimately, addressing the fundamental issues that these statues represent requires a comprehensive approach, combining historical recognition, education, and empathy to foster inclusivity and societal growth."
"Automated IV pumps have become an integral part of modern healthcare systems, providing numerous benefits to patients and healthcare providers.

"Eat Lancet recommendations are developed to integrate healthy eating habits with the practices that minimize the harm to the planet Earth resulting from some foods’ manufacturing or farming approaches. The goal is to ensure that the biodiversity of the planet is preserved while people continue to eat delicious and healthy foods. This paper will examine Lancet’s EAT recommendations, compare this diet to personal eating habits, and discuss whether modifications can be made.
My current diet is different from the EAT recommendations provided by Lancet.
Firstly, my diet mostly consists of prepackaged or takeout foods, although I add fruits to my daily food intake. However, I do not consume a lot of vegetables, nuts, and legumes, as recommended in the EAT article. Also, EAT recommendations emphasize the need to limit the consumption of red meat and dairy products, which I typically consume as well (“EAT-Lancet Commission Brief for Everyone”). I am accustomed to having dairy products, especially milk and yogurt, on a daily, and based on the EAT recommendations, and I should limit this consumption to smaller portions.
It would be difficult to modify my diet to match the EAT-Lancet recommendations. Mainly, this is because I would need to change my eating habits, meaning I would need to get used to eating and shopping for foods that are different from what I consume daily. Additionally, with the EAT diet, many of the products need to be cooked or prepared; for example, vegetables taste better if they are in a salad, which would require more time for preparation. Currently, I do not have much free time to dedicate to preparing food, which creates a challenge for me if I want a balanced and environmentally friendly diet. However, I could shop for vegetables that are already slides or buy salads and healthier foods from the places I already order from or shop at, which would make it easier to integrate these products into my diet.
One aspect that I can easily modify is my shopping habits since I often tend to buy too many fresh products that I do not eat before they perish, and thus I have to throw these away. According to Lancet, with food, “the amounts wasted or lost have major impacts on human health and environmental sustainability.” Hence, I need to pay more attention to the way I shop for fresh produce to minimize waste, which I can achieve by shopping more often but buying less produce to ensure that perishable items are eaten in time.
Moreover, this article emphasizes the impact of food on one’s health, especially due to the increasing cases of obesity in developed states. In parallel to this, many people, and children, in particular, experience acute hunger on a daily basis (Lancet). This terrific contrast prompts me to change my eating habits and ensure that I only buy the foods I can consume to ensure that there is no waste and harm to the environment. In general, this article has prompted me to rethink my eating habits and my approach to food consumption and to make small modifications that will be helpful both for my health and for the well-being of the environment. In summary, my current diet is very different from the recommendations provided by Lancet, and there are several challenges linked to modifying it to suit these recommendations."
"Electric cars have only recently begun to compete with the internal combustion engine, but they have been actively used by drivers for more than a century. These cars were especially popular at the turn of the 20th century but lost their popularity when Ford’s moving assembly line increased the availability of passenger cars (Simpson 2021). The use of electric vehicles has several advantages, including their environmental friendliness, service cost, and interesting history of the emergence of exciting technology.
The structure of an electric car is not inferior to ordinary passenger cars and may even be considered safer than the usual models. The main structural elements of an electric vehicle are battery, electric motor, transmission, on-board charger, inverter, DC converter, and electronic control system. The device of an electric car implies the absence of a clutch and gearbox, which is why they accelerate more smoothly and climb the slope easier (Magnusson 2017). Such a car does not contain engine oil and spark plugs, which reduces maintenance costs. Electric cars also don’t make much noise, drive quietly, and don’t produce noise pollution. The engine also consumes no energy when the vehicle is stationary. The transmission of an electric car is quite simple. Thanks to the onboard charger, the vehicle can be charged from the household electrical network. Thus, a simple and understandable car device can serve as one of the reasons for their ubiquity.
Climate scientists claim the electrification of vehicles is one of the best ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Fully electric cars move with the help of a large electric battery and do not produce exhaust gases. Electric vehicles are becoming more eco-friendly over time, despite the more intensive battery manufacturing process. Common gas-powered cars are the least climate-friendly option, as long-term costs and emissions cover a wide range. It reduces the risk of death from an accident and from the effect of exhaust gases on a person’s lungs. According to Dr. Tranchik’s estimates, the production emissions of electric vehicles will be compensated for six months, depending on the cleanness of the power system in which the car is charged.
Electric cars enjoy less popularity than gas-powered vehicles due to their higher initial cost. The battery capacity price should also be considered since a car that can last longer on its charge will cost more. Nevertheless, actual research shows that electric cars help drivers save money in the long run. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology team calculated the cost of the vehicle’s full life (including the purchase price, maintenance, fuel) and found that electric cars cost their owners much cheaper (Penney 2021). Today, electric vehicles are becoming safe, affordable and, produced by major brands, are starting to be sold in large volumes. The world leader in sales of such cars is Norway, which has a plan to stop selling fuel cars by 2025. A similar policy is followed by New Zealand, which is concerned about the state of the environment. The dissemination of such research would help reduce the financial costs of using cars.
The spread of electric vehicles requires infrastructure development and increased accessibility. Despite the fact that electric cars are already becoming more common on the roads, only some countries are close to their widespread use. Nevertheless, electric machines will be an excellent replacement for traditional gas and will improve the situation of the environment."

By diligently addressing security challenges and establishing standardized security standards, the promise and potential of the IoT can be fully realized in a secure and confident manner."
"From the lecture, I discovered that the word democracy partly originates from the word demes which means the small division of the bigger sections that Athens was divided into during the ancient time. The second half of the word is the Greek word Kratos which means the rule. Similarly to modern times, democracy means the rule of the people, which implies that the citizens of a certain region’s major political decisions are delivered collectively. However, there are also two main differences between Athenian and modern democracies.
The major and most palpable difference between the two systems is who was considered eligible to vote. In Athens, only adult men could influence the city’s political and administrative decisions, while women, children, and enslaved people did not have this right. Although most modern states also do not allow underage participation in the voting process, women and adults of all classes are eligible to express their civil will officially. Therefore, it can be concluded that modern democracies are generally more inclusive and representative than ancient ones.
Moreover, the prevalent number of modern democracies are representative, whereas, in ancient Greece, they were direct. It means that while citizens could directly vote for proposed laws and foreign policies in the past, individuals nowadays should elect representatives who would make legislative and policy-related decisions for them. Despite the fact that the original Greek way may seem fairer and more attractive, it is necessary to consider that, nowadays, this procedure would be nearly impossible. Indeed, in Athens, for instance, only approximately 30,000 residents had voting rights, whereas today, most countries have a population that is counted in millions and even in billions of citizens. For this reason, it becomes clear that voting for each bill would be associated with tremendous temporal and monetary investments compared to a representative system.
Nevertheless, in a conclusion, it can be argued that the gist of modern democracy is not different from the one in ancient Greece. The idea that postulates that people can and should be the bearers of political power still remains the same. Despite the fact that there are some differences between the old and the modern systems, they rather reflect the evolution of society than changes in the main principle of democracy."
"One factor contributing to the underreporting of crime is the reluctance of individuals to report offenses, particularly in cases of non-violent or minor crimes. The fear of retaliation, skepticism about justice system effectiveness, and the desire to protect families or community members can lead to a significant number of crimes going unreported. Research supports this notion, with several studies revealing vast discrepancies between reported and estimated crime numbers. For example, a study conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated that only 43% of violent crimes are reported to the police. This finding highlights the significant gap between the official crime statistics and the actual number of offenses occurring in society.
Furthermore, crime rates can be influenced by factors such as law enforcement policies and practices. The over-policing of certain minority communities, coupled with biased arrest and charging practices, can result in an overrepresentation of crimes committed by these groups in official statistics. This phenomenon is particularly evident in drug-related offenses, where studies consistently show that minority communities face disproportionally higher arrest rates despite comparable rates of drug use across racial and ethnic groups. As a result, crime rates become distorted and fail to provide an accurate reflection of criminal activity in society.
Socioeconomic factors also play a vital role in the accuracy of crime rates. It is well-documented that crime rates tend to be higher in areas with higher levels of poverty, unemployment, and inequality. However, individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds may be less likely to report crimes or interact with the criminal justice system due to various barriers, including limited access to legal resources and skepticism towards the system itself. Consequently, underreporting of crimes in impoverished communities further skews the accuracy of crime rates.
In conclusion, crime rates in the United States do not accurately reflect the actual number of crimes committed due to various limitations and biases. Underreporting of crime, influenced by fear, mistrust, and protecting loved ones, leads to a significant discrepancy between official statistics and real-life criminal activity. Simultaneously, overreporting occurs as a consequence of biased law enforcement practices and over-policing, particularly impacting marginalized communities. Furthermore, socioeconomic factors contribute to the inaccuracies, as individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds face barriers that inhibit their interactions with the criminal justice system. Therefore, it is essential for policymakers and researchers to acknowledge and address these limitations in order to obtain a more accurate understanding of crime rates and develop effective strategies to combat crime in the United States."
"Introduction (100 words):
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges on a global scale, affecting various aspects of society, including economic stability. This essay aims to analyze the impact of the pandemic on inflation beliefs, examining its influence on consumer behavior, central bank policies, and the overall economic landscape. As the pandemic has led to substantial changes in consumption patterns, government responses, and fiscal policies, it is crucial to understand how these developments have affected public perceptions of inflation and its implications.
Body Paragraph 1: Consumer Behavior and Saving Patterns (100 words):
The pandemic induced significant shifts in consumer behavior, as fear and uncertainty prompted widespread changes in spending and saving habits. Governments worldwide implemented lockdown measures, leading to reduced discretionary expenditure and increased precautionary savings. As individuals downscaled their consumption and prioritized essential items, this sudden shift affected demand and supply dynamics, contributing to fluctuating inflation expectations. The perceived scarcity of goods and services during the early stages of the pandemic may have fueled concerns about inflation, leading individuals to adjust their inflation beliefs accordingly.
Body Paragraph 2: Central Bank Policies and Quantitative Easing (100 words):
In response to the economic disruptions caused by the pandemic, many central banks globally implemented expansionary monetary policies, including quantitative easing. These policies involved vast injections of liquidity into the markets to support economic recovery. Such measures can potentially fuel inflation if not carefully managed. Consequently, individuals' inflation beliefs may have been influenced by concerns over the central bank's ability to control inflation once the economy starts to regain stability. Public perceptions regarding the potential inflationary consequences of these extraordinary monetary measures can contribute to shifts in inflation beliefs.
Body Paragraph 3: Fiscal Policies and Government Stimulus (100 words):
Governments worldwide implemented substantial fiscal stimulus packages to combat the economic fallout induced by the pandemic. While these measures aimed to support businesses and preserve jobs, concerns arose regarding their long-term implications for inflation. The scale and nature of the stimulus packages raised questions about the potential impact on the money supply and public debt, thereby influencing public inflation expectations. As fiscal deficits grew, individuals and investors may have become more cautious about potential inflationary pressures, leading to changes in their beliefs and investment strategies.
Conclusion (100 words):
The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly influenced inflation beliefs due to the various economic disruptions and policy responses that accompanied it. Consumer behavior, central bank policies, and fiscal measures have all contributed to shifts in individuals' perceptions of inflation. The clear link between these developments and inflation beliefs underscores the importance of understanding and monitoring public expectations, as these expectations can significantly impact economic outcomes. Policymakers and central banks must be mindful of these changing beliefs, ensuring effective communication to foster confidence in their inflation management strategies. Continuous monitoring and analysis of inflation beliefs will aid in crafting appropriate policies to maintain price stability in the aftermath of the pandemic."
"Swimmer Lia Thomas attended the University of Pennsylvania as a student. In 2021, the media focused on her successes in sports as a trans woman. Lia Thomas, a first-time competitor in the women’s division, had a strong showing. Early in December, she had her greatest college results of the year in Ohio, when she competed in the two hundred and five hundred meter sprints. After Lia Thomas’ successes at university swimming pools, she was criticized following the fact that she was born a male, which gave him an advantage. Some people argued that because Thomas was taking testosterone therapy, he had an unfair advantage over other athletes. Describing her victory to be unfair was completely wrong following the fact that trans genders are always allowed to compete by themselves. Various suggestions have been put up, including the creation of a transsexual division in the NCAA if trans individuals have such an unfair edge. Men compete with men, women compete with women, and transsexuals compete against one another.
Thomas’s success in the past seasons is a testament to his hard work and dedication. He has shown that transgender athletes can also be as successful as anyone else and should be respected for their achievements. However, the fact is that Thomas has been subject to all the same testing and regulations as any other athlete. He was not allowed to take more testosterone than any other male athlete, and his testosterone levels are closely monitored by officials. A year-long course of testosterone-suppressing therapy was prescribed following NCAA guidelines for the swimmer’s recovery. These restrictions have been deemed inadequate by the Women’s Sports Policy Task Force, for example, in the case of athletes who begin their transitioning after puberty."
"Formal Institutions
Political System
Italy is a European nation found along the Mediterranean coastline, with Rome as its capital city. Kings initially ruled the Italian up to the Second World War. Nevertheless, in 1946, Italians decided to overthrow the empire, and the nation became an independent state. The initial State continued until 1992, when scandals devastated Italy’s main political parties. Due to those major improvements in the parties, the era is known as the Second Republic, even though there were no constitutional changes (Capussela, 2018). Sergio Matterella is the current president of Italy, even though it is a ceremonial duty.
Legal System
Italy is a republic with a constitution composed of 139 reports demonstrating society’s elementary ground from 1948. The reports are into three main groups: essential philosophies, human rights and responsibilities, and republican organization (Capussela, 2018). The national assembly and regional members elect Italy’s presidents by secret ballot. Parliament elects Presidents for seven-year terms to prevent re-election by the same parliament.
There are three government systems in Italy, including legislative, judicial, and executive. As the head of the council, the prime ministers oversee and executive authority to the Council of Ministers who carry outlaws and other political decisions (Capussela, 2018). Acts are typically presented to the parliament, but in cases of urgency, bills can get approval through decrees or if the national assembly offers the council the responsibility to act.
Economic System
The Italian economy consists of established industries in the North owned by private companies and a less established, heavily subsidized agrarian in the South afflicted by poverty and poor infrastructure. The manufacturing of slightly elevated consumer products by midsized and small commercials, most of which are kinship, is a major booster of the Italian economy. In addition, Italy possesses a substantial subterranean economy, constituting approximately 17 percent of the GDP (Capussela, 2018). Farming, service industries, and infrastructure are possibly the most dominant regions to find these events.
Italy falls in third place economically in Europe, but its extremely high public bills and structural growth constraints have made it sensitive to financial sector scrutiny. Since 2007, Italy’s community bills have continuously risen, surpassing 131 percent of the GDP in 2017 (Capussela, 2018). However, shareholders’ fear about Italy and the broader eurozone disaster subsided in 2013, reducing Italy’s administration bills borrowing rates.
Informal Institution
Components of the Culture
According to research, Italian is the State’s official language, and almost 93 percent of people speak Italian as their native language (Morretta et al., 2020). Italy’s languages include Sardinian and Piedmontese. Roman Catholicism is Italy’s most commonly practiced religion (Morretta et al., 2020). It is unsurprising, provided that Vatican City is found at the center of Rome and is the place of Roman Catholicism and home of the Pope.
Several architectural styles emerged in Italy but not limited to Renaissance, Baroque and Classical Roman (Morretta et al., 2020). The Colosseum and the Leaning Tower of Pisa are examples of the global’s most known structures in Italy. Most individuals view Italian cooking as an art, which has impacted food culture globally. For instance, pasta, wine, and cheese are predominant in Italian cooking. Pasta is found in various forms, including popular varieties such as spaghetti, lasagna, and linguine.
Context of Culture
Italy is a high-context society, and the majority of Italian cultural interaction relies heavily on physical indicators. A significant part of the content in high-context principles is hidden in the bodily setting of the person (Morretta et al., 2020). For example, the speaker believes that no explanation is necessary because the person to whom they are speaking should comprehend what they are trying to express.
Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions
The concept is used to identify cultural variations between nations. Some of the Hofstede cultural aspects in Italy include individualism and power distance (Burton et al., 2021). The individualism aspect addresses people’s opinions of various groups in their environment. When a person is individualistic, they perceive themselves and their close family as vital. In contrast, collective individuals are concerned with the welfare of a larger group, including their corporation, and prioritize their own needs.
Italians thrive in individualism because they prioritize their close family over their friends and would rather do business with individuals they recognize and rely on when there is a need. The in-group then makes decisions, and meetings are mostly intended to tell the rest of the group about the results. On the other hand, power distance refers to the degree to which those at the bottom of the hierarchy embrace and even anticipate authority to be dispersed unfairly (Burton et al., 2021). This aspect demonstrates that Italians demand a certain amount of power distance. On the other hand, they like making fun of authority, and breaching rules appear to be an Italian pastime.
Resources and Capabilities
Natural and Geographic Resources
Italy has many natural resources, including crude oil deposits, pyrites, fluorspar, potash, pumice, coal, asbestos, and mercury, to mention a few (Cimini et al., 2020). The country’s mineral resources, such as petroleum and other rare earth elements, impact the Italian economy. Italy is a country found in a boot-shaped peninsula that extends outwards into the Adriatic Sea and Tyrrhenian and other water supply sources in the Southern part of Europe.
The county’s geographical position has a significant impact on its heritage. The sea surrounds Italy, and its core is subdivided into sections by mountains. The Alps, which extend across the State’s summit, are dotted with long, thin icy lakes, and the Apennines Mountains extend from the South to the Western end of the Alps down the peninsula (Cimini et al., 2020). The wooded slopes West of the Apennines resides several of Italy’s ancient cities, especially Rome.
Technological Advancement
Italy has dominated the European Union and financial markets, certainly bringing severe economic issues. However, Italy is the second-largest producer among the twenty-eight European Union member nations, close after Germany (Cimini et al., 2020). Italy is at the vanguard of the Fourth Industrial Insurgency facets, particularly in the information insurgency. Italy falls in the top 10 in the world regarding robotic intensity or the number of factory robots per worker, significantly outnumbering countries such as France, the United Kingdom, and Spain, with 132, 71, and 160 robots.
Development of Infrastructure
Italy is concentrating on massive infrastructure projects to boost its economy. The Italian directorate declared withdrawal limitations on 130 construction projects regarded crucial for reopening the country’s economy and modernizing its infrastructure network on the same day that the European Union reduced its 2020 GDP prediction for Italy to fall by 11.2 percent (Cimini et al., 2020). Italy’s major projects include; A proposed motorway between Rome and Latina, the expressway construction joining central Italy and Liguria, and the Ionica state route with links to the Port of Civitavecchia, which is just a few cases.
International Trade
Imports
Italy usually imports engineering and metal items, particularly from France, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and Germany (Bontempi et al., 2021). Imports of vehicles, minerals, and chemicals are also significant products to the Italian economy. Italy imports energy and crude oil, especially from the Middle East and North Africa.
Exports
Metals, fine machinery, and metal products constitute Italy’s two largest exports. Italy is also a well-known exporter of apparel and footwear and scooters, automobiles, notably luxury motor cars and motorbikes. Pharmaceuticals, other chemicals, and various culinary goods are exported from Italy (Bontempi et al., 2021). Italy distributes approximately 56 percent of its goods to other European Union nations, primarily Spain, Germany, and France (Bontempi et al., 2021). However, the United States of America and Switzerland are also important trade associates of Italy.
Trade Advantage
Italy is among the five States which enjoy a trade export surplus in the European nations. Italian firms are determined to retain their export edge. They invested majorly in new production technologies such as robots, factory automation, and additive production, which boost output and lower prices (Bontempi et al., 2021). Invitalia and State agency offers broad benefits to both Italian and foreign corporations through funding initiatives of all kinds in vital sectors such as factories, environmental protection, and tourism.
Economic Trade Conditions
Italy had a Gross domestic product of approximately $1.85 trillion in 2020 and a per capita Gross domestic product of about $31,630 (Bontempi et al., 2021). Italy falls in eighth place economically in the current world ranking. Due to the Corona infection and the Italian administration’s containment actions, Italy’s GDP will reduce by approximately 8.9 percent in 2020 (Bontempi et al., 2021). Nevertheless, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development anticipated that Italy’s GDP would grow either in 2021 or 2022, with about 4.5 percent in 2021 and about 4.4 percent in 2022.
International Trade Policy
Being a part of the European Union, Italy follows EU legislation that applies throughout the EU. Import obstacles based on tariffs come from both national and EU rules (Bontempi et al., 2021). Even though some limits exist to particular categories of goods, the European Union’s international trade policy is largely flexible, for example, agricultural goods. However, Italy is a member of the European Union and the World Trade Organization. Hence, it uses the Technical Barriers to Trade team to deliberate on some critical trade issues and research the choices and executions of the regulations.
Instruments of Trade policy
Italy is a European Union associate; therefore, products easily move between associate states just after establishing the internal market (Bontempi et al., 2021). Even though the unrestricted distribution of goods subsists within Customs Union, the Common Custom Policy exists for products brought from other states, enabling uniform customs taxes to be applied irrespective of the origin member state.
Foreign Direct Investment
FDI Flow and Stock
Foreign Direct Investment flows in Italy withstood an overall negative trend, increasing by 2 percent, maintaining a trend that began in 1998. Between 1990 and 2001, its outward FDI stock increased sixfold, making it a net outward investor. Italy’s FDI stock spreads geographically inbound and outbound in the Netherlands, Switzerland, and France (Bayar & Ozturk, 2018). In 2020, Italy’s inward FDI stock was valued at approximately 469.29 billion dollars compared to 443.53 billion dollars in the past year (Bayar & Ozturk, 2018). The Foreign Direct Investment to GDP ratio is low, implying more investment
Multinational Enterprises
Numerous multinational corporations on Italian soil contribute significantly to the State’s employment rate. Over 80 percent of the 1.3 million Italians hired worked in the top ten corporations, with United States firms alone employing roughly 300.000 people (Bayar & Ozturk, 2018). However, the French retailer Auchan, which recruits over 12.000 individuals in its stores and supermarkets, is the largest multinational firm in Italy in terms of employed labor.
Foreign Exchange
Currency and Exchange
Italians mainly use Euro as a form of exchange for products and services. One Euro is denominated into cents, and when purchasing money in Italy, one has to search for the EUR currency code, denoted by the notation (Febrero et al., 2018). The European System of Central Banks devises a model for determining the Euro’s foreign currency exchange rates in Italy. The rates are based on a day-to-day concertation mechanism among the world’s most powerful central banks.
Price Difference and Balance of Payments
Italy’s consumer spending financial account was about EUR2791.00 million in November 2021. According to past data, it attained an all-time high of 9404.00 Million euros in April 2021 and a slight decline of negative 1062.00 Million euros in March 2021 (Febrero et al., 2018). Economic Survey gives the exact current value, a previous data chart, and related metrics for Italy – Current account surplus, financial information – latest updated from the EUROSTAT on February 2022."
"A commercial business operates by increasing or maintaining profits. However, one of the agency costs is the excessive pre-requestive. This expense allows the contractor to get more, but does not affect the well-being of investors. Shirking of the company’s top management also creates agency costs, as it reduces the productivity of management and creates additional costs for the founders. Therefore, the earnings of other employees may decrease in this regard. In such a situation, a business must consider the ethics of its behavior.
Corporate business requires companies to take full responsibility for how the achievement of their goals affects the world around them. Consumers, investors and employees of companies are aware of the possibilities of modern corporations (Bansal et al., 2021). In this regard, it is necessary to direct them not only to making a profit, but also to improving the life of society as a whole and developing human capital responsibility. The enterprise is obliged to carry out actions aimed at improving the condition of society, and not at its deterioration (Hoffman, 2018). The implementation of corporate social responsibility of the organization also includes responsibility to employees: the provision of an additional social package, which includes the formation of a pension system, medical insurance and recreation.
The ethical attitude includes the sensational case of Wells Fargo, one of the largest US banking holdings. In 2016, about 2 million credit cards issued without the knowledge of customers were discovered, the bank was fined $ 185 million, and the management fired about 1,000 employees. Investors were dissatisfied with the fact that the bank had ceased to be reliable and lost confidence in the eyes of customers, and the public considered the real culprits of what had happened not to junior employees, but to top managers of the company. The profits of the company demonstrated a decline during this period.
On the other hand, Nike is deeply convinced that it is possible to implement more sustainable practices in all areas of the company. To reduce the carbon footprint of Nike.com in the US, in 2020 the sports giant announced a partnership with environmental investment fund EFM. With the help of Nike, the foundation was able to plant more than 100 square kilometers of forest plantations to absorb carbon from the Earth’s atmosphere. Proper management and professional tree care increase the amount of recycled substances on Nike plantations by 30%. At the same, the revenue of the company kept on almost the same level as during the previous years due to increasing costs. However, the business maintained a reputation in the eyes of its customers.
In conclusion, currently, many companies pay considerable attention to compliance with the principles of corporate social responsibility. This is based on the fact that it is the observance of the principles of social responsibility that allows enterprises to improve their performance, both economic and social performance. On the one hand, corporate social responsibility is seen as an essential element of the competition strategy. On the other hand, corporate social responsibility is a consequence of the ethical behavior of an organization in the market, which is associated with the attitude towards the subjects of the external and internal environment or with an approach that takes into account three main areas (ecology, economics, sociology) as a factor of sustainable development."
"This week focused on the second chapter of the textbook that discusses the nature of people and culture. The first key point is the understanding that culture is the framework of life and influences the aspects of life for every individual (De Melendez & Beck, 2018). Therefore, everything a person does, how they perceive things, their dress code, likes and dislikes, approach to social and political issues, and interaction with others is influenced by one’s culture. This understanding will improve how I view and relate to people at work and in social spaces because different cultures will create different life approaches and styles.
It is crucial to find an explanation for classroom behavior among learners. The second point from the text states that students’ manners, conduct, and reactions can be attributed to their culture (De Melendez & Beck, 2018). As such, acceptable acts by one learner may become unacceptable to another or to the teacher. Since children begin to learn their culture from birth, most of them will have the behaviors adopted from parents, older siblings, and other close relatives. This knowledge will help me to understand my students and plan the best experiences for every learner in the classroom.
Lastly, although culture belongs to society, there are differences between individuals in the same cultural groups. Such distinctions are seen in a classroom where each learner has a unique way of expressing themselves and reacting to various topics. Therefore, even people within the same family or community may exhibit varying behaviors and manners (De Melendez & Beck, 2018). Such differences originate from socialization and individual distinctions. After reading this chapter, while in the classroom, I will treat each student as unique and culturally different guarantee each of them receives the best attention and directions during the learning process."
"Introduction (150 words):
The late Middle Ages in Western Europe, also known as the medieval period, witnessed a significant economic crisis that impacted various aspects of society and culture. This essay aims to analyze the factors that contributed to this recession and subsequent decline, as well as its profound impact on Western European societies during the time. By understanding the causes and consequences of this crisis, valuable lessons can be gleaned to inform current economic practices and policies.
I. Factors Contributing to the Economic Crisis (400 words):

By analyzing this crisis and its impact, valuable lessons can be learned, guiding contemporary economic practices and policies to prevent similar consequences in the future."
"The healthcare industry typically draws sufficient attention to patients’ education, especially when it comes to representatives of minority groups. That is why the article by McCurley et al. (2017) offers valuable information. The researchers demonstrate that Hispanic individuals deal with improved diabetes prevention when they participate in individual and group face-to-face sessions (McCurley et al., 2017). I believe that there is an apparent reason why such positive outcomes are achieved. It seems that face-to-face interventions are effective because patients have an opportunity to ask questions if they require explanations. Simultaneously, such educational sessions demonstrate that a patient is not unique with such a health issue. As a result, such interventions can improve people’s morale, which, in turn, will lead to increased motivation to take preventive measures and protect health.
This information allows for supposing that face-to-face interventions can be suitable to my practicum project that considers measures to improve access to care among African Americans with heart failure diseases. However, the focus on patients’ cultural backgrounds should not lead to ignoring a broader context. This statement refers to the findings by Cajiita et al. (2017), who stipulate that the use of mobile technology in healthcare (mHealth) can promote better knowledge. These scholars focused on 129 older adults, and almost 25% were African Americans, to analyze whether mHealth leads to improved care (Cajiita et al., 2017). The use of mobile technologies can be as effective as face-to-face interventions because modern people spend more time online. That is why it is reasonable to rely on mHealth opportunities to improve access to care among African Americans. Finally, it is possible to suggest that combining mobile technologies and face-to-face educational sessions can result in the best outcomes."
"Introduction (100 words):
Social inequality is a pervasive issue that spans from macro-scale factors like income segregation and development prioritization to micro-scale factors such as ambiguous data on the poorest population and inequality in school environments. This essay delves into the causes and consequences of social inequality, emphasizing the role of institutional discrimination and individual characteristics in perpetuating it. Furthermore, it explores the limitations of historic solutions and the potential for preventative approaches to address social inequality in the long term. By discussing these multifaceted dimensions, we can better understand the challenges involved in tackling social inequality and propose effective solutions.
Causes of Social Inequality (150 words):
Social inequality arises from a complex interplay of macro-scale factors and micro-scale factors. Macro-scale factors include income segregation and development prioritization. Income segregation, fueled by economic policies and urban planning, spatially segregates individuals based on wealth, leading to unequal access to resources and opportunities. Development prioritization, where governments allocate resources disproportionately to already advantaged regions, exacerbates territorial disparities.
Micro-scale factors, on the other hand, encompass ambiguous data on the poorest population and inequality in school environments. Ambiguous data on poverty prevents an accurate assessment of the root causes, hindering effective policymaking. Likewise, inequality in school environments perpetuates social inequality by limiting educational opportunities and reinforcing socio-economic disparities.
Consequences of Social Inequality (150 words):
The consequences of social inequality are profound and far-reaching. Financial disparities lead to limited access to quality education, healthcare, and housing, perpetuating a cycle of poverty. Social mobility becomes elusive for disadvantaged individuals, entrenching inequality across generations. Additionally, social inequality engenders a sense of injustice, eroding trust in social institutions and increasing social tensions. Income inequality is also linked to higher crime rates and poorer mental health outcomes, further destabilizing communities.
Role of Institutional Discrimination and Individual Characteristics (150 words):
Institutional discrimination, embedded in laws, policies, and societal norms, plays a pivotal role in perpetuating social inequality. Discrimination based on race, gender, ethnicity, or other characteristics limits opportunities, creates barriers to upward mobility, and reinforces inequalities. Moreover, individual characteristics such as one's socio-economic background, education level, and inherited wealth often determine life chances and exacerbate social disparities.
Challenges in Addressing Social Inequality (150 words):
Addressing social inequality faces several challenges. Firstly, historic solutions have been limited in their effectiveness, often failing to adequately address the root causes. Additionally, combating social inequality requires broad-based systemic reforms that require political will and structural changes. Overcoming resistance to change and dismantling entrenched power dynamics may prove arduous. Furthermore, inconsistent and ambiguous data on the poorest population hinders accurate assessments, making targeted interventions challenging. Lastly, preventing social inequality in the long term requires a shift from reactive measures to proactive approaches, which may demand significant investment and coordinated efforts across sectors.
Potential for Preventative Approaches and Limitations (100 words):
Preventative approaches offer promise in tackling social inequality in the long term. Comprehensive education, healthcare, and social welfare policies can help break the intergenerational cycle of poverty. Addressing institutional discrimination through fair legislation and promoting inclusive societal norms can foster equal opportunities. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge the potential limitations of such approaches, including financial constraints, resistance to change, and the need for sustained commitment from policymakers and society as a whole.
Conclusion (50 words):
Social inequality is a multifaceted issue influenced by macro-scale factors like income segregation and development prioritization, as well as micro-scale factors like ambiguous data on the poorest population and inequality in school environments. Addressing this complex challenge necessitates dismantling institutional discrimination, addressing systemic causes, and adopting preventative approaches. Only through a holistic and proactive approach can societies strive to mitigate social inequality and pave the way for a more equitable future."
"The problem of slavery in the United States is a complex set of socio-economic, socio-political, civil-legal, racial issues, the roots of which go deep into American history. The video published by Annenberg Learner (2019) describes the confrontation development between the North and the South, investigating the human side of historical changes. The main points highlighted in the lecture are focused on the socio-economic differences between the two systems, the actual life of slaves, and methods of blacks’ rebellion.
To begin with, it is worth noting that the two regions constituting a union, in fact, were not that culturally and ideologically different. The American society of the 1860s remained, with scarce exceptions, deeply racist. The North, in this respect, perhaps even ahead of the South, where whites at least did not shy away from living with their black slaves under the same roof. Slavery in the North was abolished not for religious and moral, but for economic reasons. Because of the climate, such labor-intensive sectors of agriculture as rice growing, cotton growing, tobacco growing, where slave labor had the most significant effect, simply did not develop. The way the slaves’ liberation was carried out says a lot about the northern society, the degree of its infection with xenophobia.
Moreover, the North and the South shared economic interests since both aspired to develop western territories, the construction of railways. The South also used northern ships to conquer new markets. However, as pointed out in the video, the Northerners did criticize southern slavery for its cruelty and barbarism, depicting horrifying stories of black people suffering from the rules of institutions in which they found themselves, at the same time having the same desires and dreams as other Americans.
Furthermore, the second point concerns the life of slaves and how it used to be perceived in the South as opposed to the ideas shared in the North in this regard. Southerners justified the slavery system primarily by claiming that blacks were much happier and safer. Moreover, the slave owners ridiculed and condemned the capitalist way of life of the northerners, considering a free worker much more powerless than the people of color. The main argument in favor of this position was that slaves freely expressed their identity by singing folk songs and preaching their customs and religion. At the same time, photographs of mutilated blacks and fugitives’ stories expose the southern system’s terrible side, sobering from the naive and blind belief that slavery will grant more freedom and tranquility. Thus, the actual life of people of color over time takes on more and more realistic outlines, explaining the true meaning of the songs of the enslaved ones.
Finally, the lecture details the opposition to the system by the blacks themselves. The striving for literacy can be considered an example of the struggle for freedom. Although this education was strictly not encouraged by the owners, blacks understood that the path to liberation lay through the ability to read, write and state their thoughts. Moreover, the new desired order was transmitted through songs, stories, and disobedience by the slave owner. People of color created a world where the weak win, and the slaves become free in fairy tales and sayings. They also sought to carve their free temper through petty and more severe defiance, from theft to physical abuse.
In general, the video shares substantial everyday and cultural moments that are important for understanding the slavery system and the preconditions of the American Civil War. However, several details remain unclear in this discussion. First, since it was noted that the northern states were even more xenophobic, why did they so vehemently criticize the southerners, who, in turn, did not shy away from being in close contact with the slaves. Second, given that the southern economy was lagging behind in development, why was the Confederation so opposed to capitalism, especially given its dependence on exports and the agricultural industry? It is hard to imagine that the issue of slavery was so fundamental that the southern states were even ready to leave the union."
"The introduction of project management standards is vital for any organization as it will improve collaboration between employees and goal achievement. Thus, the recommended strategy focuses on creating the roadmap for the project. It should imply working with interim goals and a final purpose (Kerzner, 2017). Thus, the standards should include improved teamwork, the discussion between team members, and the attainment of high standards and outcomes via collaborative effort. The first standard is critical for any organization as an aligned work of teams is vital for their evolution. The employees should be provided with the opportunity and tools to create high-performance groups and engage in interaction and decision-making. For instance, Basecamp can be employed as an application to create a platform for workers to discuss current tasks and share information (Biafore, 2020). Adding them to specific groups will help to distribute tasks and attain outlined standards.
Moreover, the collaborative effort can be managed by creating clear lists of deliverables and presenting them to teams. Providing them with information about current goals and tasks will result in higher awareness and better distribution of responsibilities, which is vital for meeting new standards and promoting positive outcomes. In such a way, the recommended strategy implies focusing on improving group work and introducing standards such as cooperation and collaboration by using available tools, such as Basecamp. It will allow individuals to discuss various aspects of their work, share information related to specific goals, and create smaller teams regarding the existing requirements (Kerzner, 2017). Following the given strategy, it is possible to achieve significant improvement in performance and ensure the company will move forward to achieving new goals."
"The article of Zulaika (2022) presents the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on adolescent pregnancy and school dropout among secondary school girls in Kenya. The cases of teenage pregnancy started in Kenya after the country-wide school closure that started from March 2020 and lasted until January 2021. Zulaika (2022) examine to what extent the pandemic affected sexual and reproductive health of adolescents in Rarieda subcounty. The study shows there was a limited involvement of health administrators on the issue of pregnancy among school girls. Teenagers lack sexual education and are not aware of different methods of protection. Health administrators should find this issue important as early pregnancy can be dangerous for girls’ health and lead to various socio-economic problems in the future. Moreover, if such a rate of adolescent pregnancy continues to increase, there would be less educated females in Kenya. Zulaika (2022) also mentions that stress level of pregnant teenagers is high, affecting mental as well as physical health of young future mothers. To tackle this issue, Zulaika (2022) suggests implementing population-level emergencies on girls that are going to school. Students should be educated for the basics of sexual education and for the side effects of sexual life. Furthermore, the article points out that infectious diseases can be spread rapidly if school girls do not know the importance of contraceptives. As such, there is a need to the national project of informing school students and their parents about sexual and reproductive issues. The effects of COVID-19 on teenage pregnancy are negative, causing additional social and economic problems not only for the pregnant girls and their families but also for the whole country."
"The chapter in question tells the story of how global trade has enriched and changed cultures. During the analyzed period, many wealthy rulers and merchants began to demonstrate their power by acquiring exotic works of art. Ideas and books circulated, and cultural exchange was extremely active. People became more tolerant of diversity and more aware of how diverse the world around them was. Ties between different cultures were strengthened because of the continuing strong globalization. European influence had spread so far that the norms and habits of people from the West were beginning to be considered universal and objective (Adelman et al., 2021, p. 597). The key term of the era becomes the Enlightenment, marking a period of triumph of human reason. People begin to think that they can understand the laws of nature and human behavior. The importance of the chapter lies in its multifaceted analysis of the period, taking into account the contribution of each continent.
Among the major events, the book describes is how the three great powers formed a group in West and South Asia. The author describes how the rulers of the Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal dynasties contributed to the cultural development of their countries. The development of China, Japan, the two Americas, the slave states of Africa, and the development of Australia are also narrated. Particular emphasis is placed on how the interaction and mutual influence of different cultures contributed to their overall development. The sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries saw a global cultural renaissance brought on by the growth of new wealth (Adelman et al., 2021, p. 595). There was an increase in the consumption of books, and a greater number of previously unseen monuments were formed (Adelman et al., 2021, p. 595). The world has become highly integrated due to the spread of international trade. However, not all countries were willing to change and only agreed to adapt to the new norms. The Islamic and Chinese worlds generally maintained their identities, but America and Oceania could not resist European cultural pressure."
"The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns in Kenya have had a profound impact on various aspects of society, particularly on adolescent girls. One concerning consequence has been the increase in adolescent pregnancy and school dropout rates among secondary school girls. This essay aims to examine the extent to which these lockdowns have affected these rates, considering factors such as limited involvement of health administrators, lack of sexual education, and potential socio-economic consequences.
During the COVID-19 lockdowns, the limited involvement of health administrators has contributed to the rise in adolescent pregnancies. With healthcare resources diverted to pandemic response, reproductive health services, including contraception and family planning, were not prioritized. This lack of access to these essential services has left many adolescent girls vulnerable to unintended pregnancies.
Moreover, the lack of comprehensive sexual education has left these girls ill-equipped in making informed decisions regarding their sexual health. The closure of schools during the lockdown meant that students missed out on vital information about contraception, sexually transmitted infections, and consent. Without this knowledge, adolescent girls are more likely to engage in risky sexual behaviors, leading to higher rates of pregnancies and ultimately, school dropouts.
The consequences of adolescent pregnancies extend far beyond individual health outcomes. The socio-economic consequences of increased school dropouts among secondary school girls are significant. Adolescent girls who become pregnant are often forced to drop out of school due to social stigma or lack of support. This not only limits their future earning potential but also perpetuates the cycle of poverty.
In response to these issues, Zulaika (2022) puts forth several suggestions for addressing the challenges faced by adolescent girls during the pandemic. These include ensuring the provision of sexual and reproductive health services, implementing comprehensive sexual education programs, and promoting gender equality within the education system. These suggestions are crucial in mitigating the negative impacts of COVID-19 lockdowns on the overall health and well-being of pregnant teenagers.
Implementing population-level interventions is essential to address the underlying causes of adolescent pregnancies. These interventions should include engaging communities, parents, and religious leaders to create a supportive environment for adolescent girls. Additionally, availability and accessibility of contraceptives and reproductive health services should be ensured to prevent unintended pregnancies.
The long-term effects of adolescent pregnancies and school dropouts are detrimental to the education system and the country as a whole. Without education, these girls face limited opportunities for personal and professional growth, hindering economic development. Thus, striving towards a comprehensive approach that addresses the multifaceted factors contributing to adolescent pregnancies is essential to secure the future of Kenya.
In conclusion, the COVID-19 lockdowns in Kenya have significantly impacted adolescent pregnancy and school dropout rates among secondary school girls. Limited involvement of health administrators, lack of sexual education, and potential socio-economic consequences have all contributed to these outcomes. Addressing these issues requires comprehensive strategies such as those suggested by Zulaika (2022) and the implementation of population-level interventions. By prioritizing the overall health and well-being of pregnant teenagers, Kenya can ensure a brighter future for its education system and the country as a whole."
"Charles Schwab is a for-profit Corporation whose main business is savings and loans. The company provides banking and asset management services, and financial advisory. It has several subsidiaries – Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc., TD Ameritrade, Inc., and TD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc., which are all limited liability companies (“The Charles Schwab Corporation,” 2021). This paper aims to analyze the form of business in Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC).
Charles Schwab is a corporation, which is a form of business with some distinctive features. Firstly, its officers are agents, unlike its directors and shareholders, which means that the latter are not involved in the company’s current strategic, managerial and other business decisions (“Corporation,” 2022). Secondly, the corporation is managed by the board of directors who have the right to appoint the officers. This approach creates a balance of managerial forces, since CEOs and CFOs are directly involved in the work processes, and the board of directors, in extreme cases, has the right to dismiss them by voting.
In the corporation, shareholders are free to transfer ownership, which means that in critical situations such as bankruptcy, the corporation can be sold to another owner. This outcome is possible because the corporation is an organization that creates an opportunity for investors to profit by investing, unlike an LLC (“Forming a corporation,” 2022). Finally, in corporations, the income is taxed twice: the first time at the corporate level, and a second time if dividends are distributed to shareholders.
Thus, the form of business in Charles Schwab Corporation was analyzed. The CSC is a corporation with several subsidiaries and conducts business following the requirements for a corporation form of organization. A distinctive feature of corporations is the board of directors, which has an indirect influence on daily decision-making. Still, in critical cases, it can appoint new officers to manage the company. Corporations can also transfer property rights in the event of bankruptcy or other cases."
"Introduction:
Press freedom is a fundamental tenet of democracy and plays a crucial role in providing citizens with unbiased information and holding institutions accountable. However, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), press freedom is subject to several limitations imposed by governmental bodies and cultural norms. This essay aims to discuss the various restrictions on press freedom in the UAE and how they impact journalism in the country. By examining the legal framework, media ownership, and cultural factors, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the limitations faced by journalists, ultimately leading to a critical evaluation of the status of press freedom in the UAE.
I. Legal Framework:
A. Restricted legislation: The UAE's legal framework contains laws that suppress press freedom, such as the Cybercrime Law and the Federal Penal Code. These laws are vaguely worded, leaving room for interpretation and abuse by authorities to curtail free speech.
B. Limited protection for whistleblowers: The absence of robust legal protection for whistleblowers creates a chilling effect, making investigative journalists reluctant to expose corruption or wrongdoing.
C. Repressive press law: The UAE's Press and Publications Law requires obtaining a license from the National Media Council, leading to self-censorship to avoid government scrutiny.
II. Media Ownership:
A. Government-controlled media: A significant portion of media outlets in the UAE is owned or influenced by the government, promoting a biased narrative and limiting diversity of opinion.
B. Limited private ownership: Strict regulations and high financial barriers make it difficult for private entities to establish independent media organizations, leading to an information landscape dominated by state-controlled media.
III. Cultural Factors:
A. Cultural norms and sensitivities: The UAE's conservative cultural values shape the narrative on topics such as religion, politics, and social issues, discouraging dissenting opinions and critical reporting that may be perceived as disrespectful or offensive.
B. Social media surveillance: Social media platforms are monitored and restricted, curtailing online journalism and encouraging self-censorship due to potential repercussions.
IV. Impact on Journalism:
A. Self-censorship: The fear of government reprisals and legal consequences leads journalists to avoid sensitive topics or report in a manner that aligns with the government's agenda, compromising investigative reporting and freedom of expression.
B. Lack of transparency and accountability: Restrictions on press freedom hinder journalists' ability to hold those in power accountable, as corruption, human rights abuses, or other significant issues are less likely to be openly addressed.
C. Impediments to public awareness: With limited access to unbiased information, the public's awareness and understanding of important issues suffer, hindering informed decision-making and democratic processes.
Conclusion:
The UAE's limitations on press freedom, manifested through restrictive legislation, government-controlled media, cultural norms, and social media surveillance, detrimentally impact journalism in the country. The legal framework, lack of media ownership diversity, and conservative cultural values contribute to self-censorship, a lack of transparency, and reduced public awareness. True press freedom can only thrive when journalists are empowered to pursue unbiased reporting and promote open dialogue without fear of persecution or legal consequences. Achieving this requires revisiting and reforming the UAE's legal framework, promoting independent media ownership, and fostering a more open and inclusive cultural environment conducive to freedom of expression. As the UAE continues to develop, the balance between cultural sensitivities and the principles of press freedom will shape the nation's media landscape for the years to come."
"Most people during the Victorian era valued the virtues of society. Victorians believed that they were fixed and certain as guiding behavior to people all the time. The virtues included morals that one can be judged according to his behavior. Any betrayal of ethical standards was termed lousy behavior and could deserve punishment. These beliefs have become misguided, undesirable, and inappropriate in modern America (Schlereth, 2018). They have shifted to values that no longer have classical ideas of wisdom, justice, courage, or cleanliness (p. 691). They have become sexual connotation where people practice prostitution and other immoral behaviors.
In previous years, there were low rates of crimes that have continued to rise. Victorians practiced moral principles in their lives, which maintained good morals and behavior. Currently, morals have changed and translated to destructive behaviors that contribute to higher rates of crimes (Schlereth, 2018). Victorian speaks about morality and the best ways of devising it. In modern America, a character has been substituted, and most youths indulge in immoral behavior.
In the Victorian era, women were illiterate, immigrants were not socializing with others, while now women are educated, and immigrants share ideas with natives. Men used to work for wages and get involved in politics while women engaged in domestic work and childrearing. In literature, each era had a different theme according to the way we understand life (p. 693). The Victorian era focused on industrialization, imperialism, domesticity, and cultural identity (Schlereth, 2018). Modern literature focused on the theme of loss, despair, and politics. Victorian era, most people were Christian and valued religion heavily compared to the current American.
The Victorian era and modern American have similarities in how the people live in the two ages. In the two generations, people practiced moral behavior cherishing virtues in society. The two value the social, economic, and political life, and the individuals participate in them (Schlereth, 2018). The eras impacted the world of literature and changed people’s lives on how they see literature (p. 695). For example, Elizabeth Barrett Browning wrote a poem, ‘The cry of the children’, which has a message about industrialization on child labor. The poem narrates child labor which had become popular due to new machines and workplaces. All people were able to socialize during the Victorian era to learn formal and informal skills. Most people get involved in literature where they write poems that could talk of their current situations and life experiences.
The Victorian and modern American eras have impacted changes to human life. For example, in England, the rate of indictable offences reduced by 50% and the population grew from 19 million to 33 million, the number of crimes reduced from 92000 to 81000. The people learned moral values and the virtues that correspond to better social, economic, and political life. In the two eras, men and women understood their roles, learned formal and informal skills, and could interact and socialize. People developed morals, and they were hardworking and successful in business. The Victorian era brought change, innovation, and invention that contributed to current technological advancements.
The modern American misses a lot from the Victorian era regarding morality, beliefs, and virtues. During the Victorian era, people valued cultural opinions, cherished integrity in society, and practiced good moral behavior. The modern American had derailed from all the norms and changed the way of life. There are practices of immoral behavior such as prostitution, many divorces, many crimes, and a lack of seriousness in religious belief. Most people have disrespect and ignorance of everything in the current world. Victorian-era people were religious and valued their religion, but a few currently do the same.
All people were able to socialize during the Victorian era to learn their roles, get an education and interact with each other. Most people get involved in literature where they write poems about their current situations and life experiences. People could write poems sensitizing an issue affecting the society for the society to take necessary measures. In the two eras, people learned formal and informal skills, which helped them handle different issues in society."
"One way in which sociology can make a valuable contribution to the understanding of the interrelation between race and health disparities is by coining a working definition of race that emphasizes its relevant aspects. Even today, when the idea of the social construction of race has long gained traction, the concept of race is often affected by the notions of physical anthropology and genetic inheritance. A proper sociological approach to the issue of race as related to health disparities may alleviate it by focusing on the stratifying principles of race, such as socioeconomic disadvantages and discrimination (Hummer, 1996). This approach will allow concentrating on the socioeconomic factors most relevant as social determinants of health and, by doing so, enable a better understanding of causal relations.
Another and more specific way in which sociology may help explain the connection between race and health disparities is by focusing on the environmental context of health. For instance, sociology may be of great help when explaining the access to opportunities for a healthier lifestyle and, in particular, diet. Kwate (2008) offers an example of what can be done in this regard in the study of the interrelation between residential segregation and fast food density. His approach involves analyzing the population, economic, physical, and social characteristics of a neighborhood to identify why fast food outlets are built at a proportionally larger scale in segregated black neighborhoods (Kwate, 2008). By doing so, Kwate (2008) shift attention from the simplistic explanations and assumptions that can steer the discussion of the problem in a wrong direction – such as the presumption that blacks like fast foods more. Thus, as in the case above, the sociological approach allows focusing on the actual structural factors behind the interrelation between race and health disparities."
"The success of a start-up craft brewery is determined by several key factors, each playing a crucial role. This essay will discuss the extent to which access to and mitigation of distribution issues, brand image and 'craft beer' niche, implementation of social media for marketing, and achieving scale economies in marketing expenditures contribute to the success of a start-up craft brewery.
One of the primary factors affecting the success of a start-up craft brewery is access to and mitigation of distribution issues. A craft brewery may produce exceptional beers, but without a reliable and efficient distribution network, it will fail to reach its target consumers. To ensure success, start-ups must establish partnerships with distributors who can effectively transport their products to a wider audience. Additionally, mitigating distribution issues includes monitoring the quality of beers during transportation, as well as strategically selecting distribution channels to serve specific regions or target markets.
Equally important is the establishment and maintenance of a strong brand image and a 'craft beer' niche. Craft breweries thrive on their ability to distinguish themselves from mass-produced commercial beers. A distinctive brand image attracts consumers seeking unique and flavorful brews. By positioning themselves as producers of high-quality, artisanal beers, start-up breweries can target a niche market willing to pay a premium for their products. Cultivating a loyal customer base through brand identity and specialization is instrumental in the success of a craft brewery.
In today's digital age, the implementation of social media for marketing is essential for the triumph of start-up craft breweries. With the rise of platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, craft breweries can engage with consumers directly, creating buzz and fostering a sense of community. Through social media, start-ups can showcase their products, share behind-the-scenes stories, and receive immediate feedback, creating valuable relationships with their customers. By effectively utilizing social media marketing strategies, start-up craft breweries can significantly enhance brand awareness and customer loyalty.
Lastly, achieving scale economies in marketing expenditures is crucial for start-up craft breweries seeking success. Marketing expenses can occupy a significant portion of a brewery's budget, particularly when aiming to penetrate new markets or expand their reach. By achieving scale economies, start-ups can reduce their marketing costs per unit, thus maximizing profitability. Collaborating with other breweries, pooling resources, and jointly marketing their products can enable start-ups to boost their visibility while minimizing expenditure.
In conclusion, the success of a start-up craft brewery is determined by various key factors. Access to and mitigation of distribution issues, the establishment of a strong brand image and 'craft beer' niche, implementation of social media for marketing, and achieving scale economies in marketing expenditures all play a significant role in determining the triumph of a start-up craft brewery. By strategically addressing these factors, start-ups can navigate the competitive craft beer industry and increase their chances of long-term success."
"Social movements are largely associated with their leaders, who represent the desires for change that needs to be made. Charisma and leadership skills are key to make individuals succeed or fail to convey their messages to the general public. Two leaders to be compared in this paper are Martin Luther King Jr., who was the leader of the movement for black rights, and Alicia Garza – the founding member of Black Lives Matter.
In Dr. King’s speech, he speaks about his vision of the future for black people. His speech is filled with faith-based rhetoric, asserting it to be not only human but divine right for individuals to be equal (Rare Facts, 2017). In his vision, individuals of all colors and racial backgrounds would live in the USA of tomorrow as equals, instead of being oppressed. Alicia Garza’s speech is focused on what is happening now, rather than a vision of tomorrow (Center for Constitutional Rights, 2015). She offers facts about how black people and especially women are oppressed in today’s white male-dominated society, how they earn less, die more, and get put into prisons more, among other things. Her speech concludes with an affirmation of who BLM are and what they stand for.
When comparing Dr. King and Alicia Garza, it is possible to see that King is a much more experienced speaker. He is used to talking to a greater audience, and has a greater baggage of hands-on experience to rely upon. His voice is booming and offers gravitas, with the first part of the speech sounding like a saga, of sorts, whereas the second one slowly induces a rousing emotion out of everyone listening to it (Rare Facts, 2017). Alicia Garza’s speech seeks to inform the public first and foremost. It is full of facts and statistics, and she appears to struggle to keep all the numbers in her mind. She keeps referring to her notes to refresh her memory (Center for Constitutional Rights, 2015). Her passion is visible in her voice, and can be seen through her actions, but overall, she gives the impression of a student giving a presentation in front of a class. Although they both speak to a predominantly black and allied audience, a notable exception is that King’s speech focuses on men, while Garza’s – on women.
The location chosen by Dr. King was a church at the Lincoln Memorial. It was a symbolic place for several reasons – first, it offered a sense of discipline and protection due to it being a place of faith. Second, it helped convey the message in two ways, by referring to Lincoln’s fight to free the slaves, and to the God’s will that all men were created equal (Greenberg & Page, 2020). Alicia’s Garza’s location looks like a place for a TED Talk, there is nothing particularly special about it. However, Alicia has the advantage of social media to spread the message, which diminishes the importance of location for gathering people and spreading the message.
Both speeches relate well to the audience they are performed for. King’s speech was witnessed not only by blacks, but also by whites and Hispanics, who felt the same about their plight. He encompassed them all as one nation under God. Alicia Garza’s words aimed predominantly at black people (Center for Constitutional Rights, 2015). It was educative in what institutional and systematic injustices they are facing, and calls for those people to join their fight against injustice worldwide. Overall, these two speeches had a different purpose to themselves – King’s was a rallying cry across the entire nation, whereas Garza’s was one of many speeches in an ongoing campaign for BLM."
"I can say that I would sequence my genome for several reasons. Firstly, even if it has a negative connotation, this information can cause anxiety and stress, but at the same time, I can use precious time to prevent a severe illness. Secondly, any genome sequencing results are essential from the point of view of science since they have the opportunity to either confirm the statistics of the majority of identical sequences or discover a new statistical outlier that carries useful scientific information for society. Finally, this information would be helpful for future generations, even within my family, to prevent similar problems in children and grandchildren. Of course, in this case, the financial accessibility of this tool is essential, and, in my opinion, sooner or later, it should be available to most people on Earth. However, such access should be given only after in-depth research into the psychological nature of the perception of the results and the reduction of possible harm to the participants’ health.
My attention was drawn to scientific information that the structure of the genome contains predispositions to certain diseases and that this information can be obtained not only in qualitative but also in quantitative representation. Surprisingly, 99.9% of people have approximately identical sequences of T, C, G, and A proteins; nevertheless, they contain certain diseases (Sanderson, 2018). The uniqueness of the series leads to a wide variety of disorders in the body, including psychological disorders (Sanderson, 2018). The importance of the psychological aspect in delivering this information to sequencing participants may provide valuable information for further research exploring the relationship between mental health disorders and genome structure (Robinson et al., 2019). A variety of diseases whose symptoms are detectable, but cannot give a complete picture among known diseases, can be studied using sequencing (Robinson et al., 2019). Finally, by sequencing the genome, people provide a fundamental understanding of some aspects of the causes of diseases, which can give impetus not only to medicine in each specific field but also to pharmacology, psychology, and other related sciences.
I try to see my doctors every year to support and prevent health. I go to the gym to keep in shape. I have some back problems and had a severe heart condition as a child, which was cured by adolescence. In my opinion, the timing of this procedure is critical because by focusing on heart disease in childhood, my parents could perceive a predisposition to a condition of a different nature with less emphasis. We need to find a balance between conscious age, responsible decision, and youth when the results of sequencing can help prevent any disease.
This information can be used to improve society in the following way. First, the nature of most serious diseases will be determined individually for each person for the purpose of prevention and care. Secondly, unknown conditions with specific symptoms can be explained in genomics. Finally, mechanisms for working with people who have deviations, including psychological ones, can be obtained in the future. The negative impact can manifest itself in the still poorly understood psychological aspect of delivering information: in some instances, it can harm a person (Sanderson, 2018). In addition, it is difficult to provide further control over the actions of a person who may leave his life unchanged or dismiss low risks of diseases (Sanderson, 2018). Finally, by making this tool more accessible, it will still be quite challenging to check all the people on the planet, leading to injustice and social conflicts."
"One of the key challenges in implementing the new revenue recognition standards is the timing of recording revenues. The ASU requires companies to recognize revenue when it is deemed probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and when specific criteria are met. This introduces complexity as companies must now exercise judgment and make subjective assessments to determine when revenues can be recorded, leading to potential inconsistencies and increased uncertainty.
The handling of variable consideration is another obstacle companies face in implementing the new revenue recognition standards. Variable consideration includes discounts, rebates, incentives, and contingent payments, which were previously recognized only when they were more likely than not to be received. Under the ASU, companies must now estimate and include the variable consideration in the transaction price, resulting in potential fluctuations and complications in revenue recognition.
In regards to the implementation of Topic 842 for leases, one of the main challenges is identifying embedded leases. Many companies enter into contracts that contain embedded leases, which are hidden leases within another contract. Identifying these leases requires careful examination and analysis, as failure to do so may result in misstated financial statements and non-compliance with the new standards.
Additionally, ensuring data accuracy poses a challenge in implementing Topic 842. Companies must gather accurate and complete data on lease agreements and related information, such as lease terms, payment terms, and lease modifications. This process may be time-consuming and resource-intensive for companies with a large number of leases, potentially necessitating the adoption of new technologies and systems to facilitate data management and accuracy.
The implementation of these new accounting standards and the challenges associated with them can have a significant impact on investor decision-making. Increased required disclosures provide investors with more detailed and transparent information about a company's revenue recognition and lease arrangements. This enables investors to make more informed decisions based on a clearer understanding of a company's financial position and performance, thereby enhancing investor confidence and potentially impacting investment choices.
In conclusion, the implementation of the new accounting standards for revenue recognition and leases, as outlined in the ASU 2020-05, presents challenges for private companies. The specific issues related to revenue recognition, such as timing and variable consideration, as well as the challenges associated with implementing Topic 842 for leases, including identifying embedded leases and ensuring data accuracy, require careful consideration and planning. While these changes may initially pose difficulties for companies, the increased required disclosures can ultimately contribute to more informed investor decision-making."

"A Western scholarship has distorted the long history of African culture for centuries, and many of its basic principles have been viewed through the lens of colonization. As a result, the ideas and tenets of African philosophy have been appropriated and changed in value from the inherent parts of people’s nature into commodities. In their works, p’Bitek and Marimba discuss such concepts as culture, spirituality, and philosophy of African nations and how Western ideology has reshaped their presentation without fully understanding their meaning. The commodification of African culture and the imposition of European views on the distinction between culture and philosophy, religion and spirituality have disrupted African people’s ability to self-identify.
The ideas by scholars show that African culture does not distinguish itself from philosophy or drive a line between reality and the spiritual nature of one’s being. European culture is presented as pragmatical and commodifying – it turns pieces of life that are meant to be used into objects for observation. p’Bitek writes that culture turns from “the way of life of a people” into “something that is bought and sold” (“What is Culture?” 14). As a result, younger generations of Africans, especially those living in Western countries, see their culture as a collection of souvenirs, not parts of everyday life. At the same time, they are subjected to the Western religions praising poverty and individualism (p’Bitek, “Man Born Unfree” 21). Ani notes that African-Americans suffer as they do not feel connected enough to traditional African society but feel a divide between themselves and European identity (49). Such disconnect leads to people losing their communal and generational identification.
The readings discussed above show that African and European ideologies clash in many ways, and the latter assumes control over the presentation of the former. As a result, generations of people are removed from their culture, losing it or seeing through the distorted lens of commodification. African culture is inherently linked to philosophy, spirituality, living in the moment, and seeing the richness of life. However, it is turned into a tourist attraction, and its people are forced to perceive it through the eyes of foreigners, losing their inherent link to history and nature."

"The US is considered a staunch supporter and promoter of democracy. However, some ethnic minorities, including Chinese and Native Americans, had suffered a lot from discrimination and had to fight for equal rights with white Americans. Despite all the oppression, they did not abandon their country during World War II and significantly contributed to the victory making the government and society see the need for collaboration.
The major contribution of Chinese Americans to WWII was their active enlisting in the US army. According to Takaki (2020), their zealous support destroyed Japanese propaganda, which portrayed Chinese Americans as victims, and made China side with the US. Despite the dire conditions many of them lived in and white Americans’ discrimination against them, they used the war as the opportunity to prove themselves as loyal patriots.
As for the Navajo tribe, they also had reasons for being hostile towards white Americans. However, they agreed to fight as allies to protect their country and people. Their main contribution was participation in coded interaction: Americans utilized Navajo’s native language as a base for it (Takaki, 2020). Thus, a minor language, which once was forbidden and was considered inferior, became a valuable instrument of victory.
It amazes me how much Chinese and Navajo Americans had suffered from discrimination, yet they fought together with white Americans for their country when the external enemy appeared. Moreover, the use of Navajo’s native language during the war is truly inspirational, as it turned the US cultural diversity into a weapon. We should not forget about this valuable experience and support minor languages and cultural traditions.
It is frustrating that immigrants or citizens with non-white ancestry had to prove their value before white Americans accepted them as equals. Unfortunately, the emergence of such movements as Black Lives Matter shows that some non-white ethnic groups still face discrimination (Garret, 2018). Therefore, new immigrants often suffer from ethnic intolerance like their predecessors did, as their languages and cultural values are considered inferior, or they do not get the same vocational and educational opportunities.
To sum up, Chinese and Navajo Americans have greatly contributed to protecting their country during WWII and proved their loyalty. Despite discrimination and oppression they had experienced from white Americans, they offered help and demonstrated the power of collaboration. The use of the native Navajo language also showed the significance of cultural diversity. These historical events gave us valuable lessons, which we should not forget."

"Introduction:
In today's ever-evolving retail landscape, e-commerce giant Amazon has expanded its reach and transformed the way consumers shop. As a crucial component of Amazon's business model, its vast network of warehousing facilities plays a significant role in meeting consumer demands efficiently. This essay aims to analyze the impact of Amazon warehousing on both consumers and communities, exploring the benefits and potential challenges associated with this pervasive aspect of modern commerce.
Body:
1. Enhanced Consumer Experience:
Amazon's warehousing infrastructure enables the company to provide an unparalleled level of convenience to consumers. With strategically placed fulfillment centers, the company can offer broad product selection, fast delivery times, and affordable options. These factors enhance the overall shopping experience, making it more efficient and accessible for a vast customer base. This convenience has revolutionized the way consumers purchase goods, saving them valuable time and effort.
2. Employment Opportunities:
Amazon's extensive warehousing operations create a gateway for employment, generating numerous job opportunities within local communities. From warehouse associates to delivery drivers, these positions offer competitive pay and flexible hours, which can be particularly beneficial for individuals seeking part-time or seasonal work. By serving as a significant source of employment, Amazon contributes to economic growth, aiding local communities in terms of income stability and reducing unemployment rates.
3. Regional Economic Growth:
Amazon's warehousing presence has the potential to stimulate regional economies. When new fulfillment centers are established, surrounding businesses often experience increased commercial activity due to a rise in employment and consumer spending. The influx of workers and associated spending also leads to indirect job creation, as businesses adjust to the demands of the expanding workforce. Amazon's investment in communities, both economically and commercially, can contribute to sustained regional development.
4. Socioeconomic Considerations:
However, it is crucial to analyze potential negative implications of Amazon's warehousing practices. As the company strives for efficiency and cost-effectiveness, concerns arise regarding working conditions and worker rights. Reports of strenuous working conditions, insufficient break times, and limited benefits have surfaced. These concerns raise issues of worker exploitation and the need for stricter labor regulations to protect the well-being of employees. Therefore, while Amazon's warehousing operations can bring benefits, it is essential to address these concerns to ensure fair treatment of workers.
5. Environmental Impact:
The rapid expansion of Amazon's warehousing infrastructure comes with significant environmental implications. The increase in transportation to and from fulfillment centers contributes to carbon emissions and traffic congestion. Additionally, the vast energy consumption required to power these centers raises concerns about sustainable practices. Amazon must prioritize investing in renewable energy sources and implementing eco-friendly transportation solutions to mitigate its environmental impact effectively.
6. Impact on Local Businesses:
While Amazon's warehousing operations benefit consumers through convenience and cost-effectiveness, they can pose challenges for local retailers. Smaller businesses often struggle to compete with Amazon's low prices, extensive product selection, and fast shipping. This dominance can result in reduced foot traffic and decreased sales, potentially leading to the closure of local stores and impacting the character of communities. Subsequently, creative solutions, such as collaboration between local businesses and the development of unique products and experiences, are essential to ensure their survival and maintain community vitality.
Conclusion:
As Amazon's warehousing network expands, its impact on consumers and communities becomes increasingly significant. Empowering consumers with convenience and choice, creating employment opportunities, and stimulating regional economies are major advantages. However, it is essential to address concerns related to worker rights and environmental sustainability. Furthermore, supporting local businesses amidst Amazon's dominance is crucial for community resilience. By carefully considering these impacts, policymakers and society must strive to find a balance that maximizes the benefits and minimizes the potential challenges associated with Amazon's extensive warehousing operations."
"History and Impact of Employing Women and Minorities in Law Enforcement
Law enforcement shows how laws are enforced and public order is maintained. White men have been disproportionately holding positions in this field for a long time. Nowadays, the situation is different, and more women and minorities are encouraged to join law enforcement professions to reduce the impact of bureaucracy and other biases. The first women and African Americans were hired as police officers in the middle of the 19th century. In the middle of the 20th century, the Civil Rights Act removed other discrimination-based debates and supported equality in public accommodations. Racial diversification of law enforcement organizations is favored to increase confidence in the police and improve police-minority relations (Sever et al., 2018). Women in law enforcement also promote decreasing in the use of physical force and misunderstandings in communities (Sever et al., 2018). Although men prevail in law enforcement employment, changes and respect cannot be ignored today.
Various Roles of Law Enforcement
Law enforcement is a vital activity of the government to enforce the law and control communities’ behaviors and relationships. The major roles of this profession are to maintain public order and manage public safety. It is expected to see how individuals suspected of criminal offenses are treated and how investigations are organized. The courts aim to ensure that suspected criminals receive fair trials and that their guilt or innocence is properly determined. The correction system, in its turn, focuses on altering behaviors to make people socially acceptable and legally abiding. When an offender is caught by the police (a law enforcement representative), it is necessary to make sure that no unnecessary violence is applied. The courts analyze each detail and conclude that all rights are considered and no mistakes are made. Corrections help people change their behaviors and understand what they should and should not do within the frames of the existing system and society."
"In relation to building construction, Code of Practice may be defined as a particular set of standards, procedures, and regulations to which a contractor and developer should adhere to manage potential environmental consequences caused by construction works. For large clients, local authorities, and public bodies, it is applied to new developments and sets out requirements related to the impact of construction. It aims to provide guidance within the framework of legal, administrative, and technical systems for the protection of workers, the environment, and the public and control over major hazard installations. According to the code, by arranging separation between large centers of population, including housing, shops, schools, and hospitals, and major hazard installations and developing appropriate emergency planning, major accidents that may occur at these installations will be prevented.
Code of Practice is applied to major hazard installations identified on the basis of a list of hazardous substances associated with threshold quantities. They require priority attention due to the potential for causing highly serious incidents that may negatively impact the environment and people. Thus, major hazard installations include oil refineries, petrochemical and chemical works, storage of flammable liquids, gas, and liquefied petroleum gas, fertilizer works, chemical warehouses, and water treatment works connected with chlorine. Nuclear hazards, hazards of a military nature, and the transportation of potentially hazardous chemicals are excluded from the code due to the differences in their control and management. In general, the code includes a list of activities for competent authorities that should be performed in order to establish major hazard control systems for the prevention of incidents. Competent authorities include government inspectorates and safety authorities, police, local authorities, workers and their representatives, works managements, fire and health authorities, suppliers of major hazard technologies, and other involved organizations."
"Sex trafficking is a major and often overlooked problem of modern societies around the world. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (2009), sex exploitation is the primary cause of human slavery, accounting for approximately 79% of all cases. In my opinion, such a crime is fueled by people’s greed, lack of media coverage and governmental attention, and the presence of substantial demand. As for the latter, often not socially acceptable forms of sexual desires and the search for lower prices serve as the sufficient driving force behind the sex slavery market.
However, what is more, important is the lack of attention from the government officials and other institutions to this problem leads to large public unawareness. On the one hand, the real and potential victims do not know how to recognize sex traffickers and behave when they encounter them. On the other hand, the general public has prejudice that most prostitutes have freedom when deciding to sell their bodies due to inability to find another job, drug abuse, or other reasons. However, modern researches and investigations into this topic reveal that it is not true in many cases. Therefore, for a long period of time, women were blamed for selling their bodies rather than men who forced them.
For a similar reason, some of the men who use the prostitutes’ services are unaware that they support the crime. Yet, there are other people who understand that they engage in sexual relationships with underage girls or enslaved women and should be punished similarly to those who traffic women. Nevertheless, I think that the former group still can be blamed for their ignorance because many of the customers of such services consider view prostitutes as an object. This, in turn, leads to the inability to be compassionate towards these women.
In order to address this problem, as was mentioned before, the government, especially in places with high women trafficking, should ensure that women are aware of how to avoid being captured. Additionally, in my opinion, the governments should have full control over a few sexual resorts and often supervise their businesses. Finally, as for trafficking in third-world countries, the U.S. should actively participate in the attempts to halt this activity and urge other countries to join the efforts. In this regard, I think that only by combining the work of all the states can humanity stop sex trafficking."
"Introduction
Darren Aronofsky is an independent American filmmaker who explores various psychological themes in his movies. While all of them are different, they may be classified as psychological thrillers, with surrealism and magical realism elements. In his various films, Aronofsky shows themes of deep psychology: love, hate, addictions, genius, relationships between humans. Mysticism and surrealism are often present: paranormal phenomena and fantastical events interrupt the main realistic narrative to highlight the central ideas of each film. Archetypical plots, such as biblical legends, are used by Aronofsky as a basis for films mother! and Noah . He often changes the original plot to make it more suitable for modern realities. In other films, such as Requiem for a Dream , and Black Swan , he explores the various pathological states of human consciousness.
Films Analysis
Mother!
The film’s main heroes are the couple living an ordinary and happy life. They both have self-describing names: a man is called Him, and a woman’s name is Mother. Him is a poet, and at the beginning of the film, he is struggling with writing block; while he is doing that, the house where he lives looks like burned remains. He places the crystal object on a pedestal, and then the remnants transform into a full and beautiful home. This fantastic scene symbolizes the power of creation, and one may already see the allegory to the creation of the world by God, and the name Him may as well be an allegory for God. Mother is his wife and muse, inspiring Him to write poems, which are usually commercially successful: he has many fans. Then, a stranger appears in Him’s house, who presents himself as Man; he pretends to be in search of a bed, but it turns out that he is the admirer of Him’s literature (Given 117). Him is generous, and he agrees that Man may stay in his house and obtain help.
Soon, he and Mother notice that Man has a deadly wound and will probably die shortly. Before that, there are several scenes of the beating heart; their meaning will be revealed at the film’s end. After some time, Man’s wife arrives, whose name is Woman, and they both stay at the Him’s house. One may see that their names symbolize manhood and womanhood in general and are allegories of biblical legend about Adam and Eve, the first people on Earth. Mother is dissatisfied by their presence and is visibly annoyed while preparing food for them (Given 117). Him, however, argues that they have the right to obtain help, as they are in a hard situation. Soon, two sons of Man and Women arrive, quarreling about their father’s will; Mother becomes even more displeased. Sons’ argument becomes brutal, and in the end, one of them kills the other.
In the second part of the film, which starts the next morning after their intercourse, Mother understands that she is pregnant, and Him is inspired by that. He writes much more actively, and his poems have an enormous commercial success (Given 118). Their life with Mother becomes happy and fruitful; however, when they organize a lunch, the mob of savage Him’s fans appears. The film ends tragically: while covering him by adulation, the mob behaves themselves as beasts and smashes Him’s house. He does not know how to stop this and is seemingly passive and disoriented (Given 118). When pregnant Mother tries to stop them, they rape and maul her, and she eventually retreats to the basement. Then, she burns out the house, leaving the burning remnants seen at the beginning of the film.
mother! has many hidden meanings, connected with symbolic representations used widely throughout the film. Names of characters are chosen carefully, and scenes are designed to show the dramatism of the situation. An example is the close-up scene of bleeding Mother, which is repeated at the beginning and at the end of the film (Given 120). Aronofsky implied a strong environmentalist message in the film: the rape and killing of Mother by the crowd symbolize the terrible and unstoppable consumption of Earth resources by people; Mother refers to Mother Nature (Given 120). When she is brutally mauled at the film’s end, it is a bright metaphor to the unconscious mob of humans who maul the Earth ecosphere similarly (Given 119). Him symbolizes the God who creates the Earth and Nature again and again: at the end of the film, he asks Mother for her love. When she consents, he takes her heart and creates a new crystal object. It reveals the sense of the beating heart, shown at the beginning of the film: it is the heart of Mother Nature, beating to support life.
Noah
The biblical plot also inspires this film, but it interprets the legend more literally, unlike the previous one. While events in mother! take place in modern reality, being only an allusion to the biblical events, Noah resembles the actual ancient times of the legendary Great Deluge. Muffled lights are used to show the visions of Noah, the main hero, about the coming Deluge, at the beginning of the film (Skorin-Kapov 121). Scenes are edited to show the blunt colors and mists, emphasizing that those are the visions in Noah’s head, not the reality; then, he consults with his grandfather about his visions. After that, Noah starts to build his ark, where he, his family, and animals will survive the Deluge. Tubal-Cain, a vice young king who previously killed Noah’s father, tries to seize the ark, but Watchers stop him. They are stone angels sent by God on Earth to defend people. It is one of the film’s fantastic elements, designed by Aronofsky by using motion design (Skorin-Kapov 124). After the retreat, Tubal-Cain starts finding people and weapons to attack the ark again.
Along with that, Noah travels to the closest settlements trying to find couples for Ham and Japeth, while Shem already has a girlfriend, Ila, rescued by Noah after the massacre. However, they see that people are extremely cruel and shameless; they threaten Noah, and he retreats with his family to their home. Noah is shown reflecting in various scenes, and this plotline is the main for the film. Meanwhile, they continue to build the ark, and Noah starts to be utterly disappointed by humanity. He thinks that God wants to wipe out humanity completely, without any recovery, and that only plant and animal life are good to live.
The film’s main idea is the fragile line between good and evil, nature and humanity, and reflections about the actuality of such a line. Noah, initially, tends to separate good and evil strictly and without any compromise (Skorin-Kapov 122). He condemns people, being sure that they are impure and sinister, and he is happy that the Great Deluge will wipe them out. Noah is vegetarian, as he thinks that animals are pure and innocent: only humans make them brutal and evil. He is even ready to sacrifice his granddaughters, born by Ila, to stop the line of human reproduction. However, he stops when seeing that they all sleep peacefully, full of love and not hate. Eventually, he transforms, and his last will to his descendants is to multiply and live well.
Requiem for a Dream
This film is not focused on divine and biblical plots; it shows ordinary people who suffered from drug addiction and all the hardships connected with it. Main heroes want only to live their lives happily and realize their dreams but cannot do that; they all become drug addicts, ending up with that in different ways. One of the main characters, Sara, spends her time watching TV while her son Harry is taking heroin along with his girlfriend Marion and friend Tyrone. The name of this film is connected with the broken dreams caused by drug addiction. Aronofsky uses scenes with close-ups and split screens to show the feeling of despair and hopelessness, typical for this extremely dark film (Skorin-Kapov 22). Various characters described there are all connected by a similar problem. They all want to realize their dreams: Sara wants to look good, Harry and Marion wish to open the cloth shop, and Tyrone to break free from the ghetto he is living in. They try to substitute their problems by taking heroin and methamphetamines; however, drugs only bring them to the bitter end when their dreams are shattered completely.
Black Swan
This film is the story of Nina Sayers, a dancer with good prospects, and is focused on her inner experience. In the ballet company where she works, there are two roles: White Swan and Black Swan, and both of them symbolize two aspects of female sexuality. While White Swan is focused on purity and innocence, Black Swan refers to dark sensuality and the power of seduction. Nina wants to take both roles, but she fails to perform the Black Swan, focused on seduction and dark sensuality. (Skorin-Kapov 95). Her mother, Erica, is overprotective and greatly influences all aspects of Nina’s life; thus, she is oversensitive and insecure, usually unable to organize her life as she wants. Then, she meets Lily, another ballerina who comes to dance in the ballet company, and two women quickly become rivals. As the film continues, Nina starts to experience hallucinations, seeing images of Lily as her “dark” alter-ego: much less technical but sensual and daring (Skorin-Kapov 95). It motivates her to dance better and better but worsens her psychical health.
This film shows the tension between “light” and “dark” aspects of the human soul, which is extremely hard to overcome. While both are interconnected, they are usually divided within a single consciousness. The roles of Black and White Swans are metaphors for such a division, and Nina’s desire to play them both is her willingness to overcome it. Eventually, she plays both roles successfully, and even Lily admits her talent. However, she ends up bleeding, and the film ends on this, leaving the viewer unsure whether she will remain alive after this successful performance. This ending scene is used by Aronofsky to emphasize the hardships underwent by Nina in trying to overcome her inner division.
Discussion
Aronofsky’s films show the extreme aspects of human nature, placing characters in challenging conditions where they are forced to show their true nature. Such positions create dramatic episodes, very bright and full of emotions experienced by characters. He uses cinematographic techniques to create a feeling of constant tension: one who watches his film is always unsure what will be next due to the thrilling and emotional atmosphere. The color range is usually limited: instead of using colors variety, different hues of one-two color are used throughout the film. Combined with slow scenes of characters’ reflections, they create a feeling of something monumental and important.
In addition to that brightness, his films are full of philosophical reflections and archetypical plots, showing the deepest motivations of the human soul. His films are often full of surrealism, exploring the human soul and its psychological archetypes. While the central part of them is realistic, there are mystical and miraculous events that cannot be explained by realism. Those surrealistic inserts aim at attracting attention to the films’ ideas, highlighting them. For example, in the already mentioned film mother! the film is ended by the fantastic transformation of the main heroine’s heart into the new house where she lives peacefully with her husband. They are also used to show the “divine interference” into human lives or depict the deep areas of the character’s psyche. An example of the latter is present in Black Swan , when Nina confronts her main rival, Lily. The film shows that Lily transforms into Nina, and thus, she is confronting herself.
Conclusion
In that way, Aronofsky’s films, while being different in plots, are dedicated to the same subject: the human soul and its elements. He uses allusions and interpretations of biblical myths to show human nature’s strong and weak sides, such as in mother! and Noah . He also shows people in drug addictions and psychical disorders, analyzing reasons which brought them to such conditions, such as in Black Swan and Requiem for a Dream . As one can see, Darren Aronofsky uses various cinematographic technics and plot twists to show the viewer how good and how bad may be a human."
"Maternal health refers to women’s wellbeing when pregnant, during childbirth, and postpartum. Black women in most parts of the world undergo unacceptable poor maternal health results, including disproportionately high death rates (Davis, 2020, p. 56). Health and societal system factors play a significant role in black women’s high maternal mortality rates and poor health outcomes. As a result, these women of color have barriers to receiving competent healthcare services and face racial discrimination. Davis (2020, p. 58) argues that factors such as sexism and racism adversely affect black women’s healthcare outcomes and medical care use. For instance, these women of color are likely to be uninsured, experience significant financial issues with healthcare, and are unlikely to access prenatal care compared to white women. At the same time, black women have high chronic health issues and preventable illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and diabetes. As a result, these health conditions adversely affect infant and maternal healthcare results when these women choose to become pregnant (Davis, 2020, p. 59). However, women of color deserve healthy and safe pregnancies and childbirth. Therefore, what factors affect black maternal health, and what systematic changes should be implemented to ensure it is improved globally?
There is a significant connection between black maternal health and women in social topics. For instance, some communities discriminate against women because of gender, color, physical ability, class, and ethnicity. Davis (2020, p. 59) explains that other individuals believe that men should be more powerful than women; therefore, they disregard ideas such as women’s leadership. Some people believe that women’s primary responsibility is taking care of the home and giving birth. These perceptions adversely affect women, leading to mental health illnesses (Davis, 2020, p. 60). Therefore, it is crucial to change people’s perspectives and views about women in society. This can be achieved by encouraging the community to view women positively and accommodate them in society.
The black maternal topic has attracted many people’s attention globally. As a result, it is crucial to determine why the number of women of color in maternal and childbirth deaths is increasing in the world. It is also essential to discover the causes of more maternal complications in black women than in white individuals. This topic will help individuals identify why healthcare organizations serving women of color have lower-quality maternity care. People should understand the challenges that black women experience to have reproductive care that meets their needs. This care is essential because it assists women in planning their families and enhances women’s and children’s healthcare outcomes.
Intersectionality involves acknowledging and understanding that every person experiences oppression and discrimination differently. Intersectionality can be used in black maternal health topics to determine and identify its causes, such as race, physical ability, and sexual orientation. These factors have adversely affected women of color globally, leading to income inequality. For example, for every dollar paid to a non-Hispanic white man, a black woman gets sixty-three cents. Corresponding to Crear-Perry et al. (2021, p. 230), the lost wages push women of color to choose between necessities such as healthcare, food, and housing because they have less money to support their livelihood. Additionally, most individuals believe that black women are strong and can handle strenuous activities than white women. Understanding the different factors contributing to black maternal health will enable individuals to develop strategies that tackle every issue for women of color.
Healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the community have a vital role in enhancing black women’s maternal health. Expansion and maintenance of health care coverage throughout women of color’s lifespan, including preventive health care access, for instance, birth control, is crucial. Only 87% of reproductive-age black females have health insurance (Crear-Perry et al., 2021, p. 233). In addition, women of color should receive high-quality, safe, culturally competent, and respectful healthcare. Healthcare and public policies should prioritize offering patient-centered care to satisfy black women’s individualized needs. Social determinants, including where people work, play, and live, should be addressed (Davis, 2020, p. 64). This can be achieved through policies that build wealth, raise incomes, and improve education. Additionally, countries should increase affordable food and health availability and enhance access to safe, clean, and affordable housing.
Black women should be offered paid leave to care for themselves and their children. Women of color need access to community healthcare providers because they provide maternal, reproductive, and primary healthcare services to them (Davis, 2020, p. 64). The absence of these professionals means that these women would not access vital healthcare services. More robust protection policies for expectant women of color should be expanded. This will ensure that employers have reasonable accommodations for pregnant women.
In summary, black women deserve healthy and safe pregnancies and childbirth. Systematic adjustments starting with the healthcare system, enhance healthcare access and provide healthier work and live places for women of color. Improving black maternal healthcare outcomes will enable women of color to achieve optimal wellbeing and health throughout their life. As a result, these individuals can have different choices, such as when and how to become parents.
My proposed Boolean Search String in this topic might be “problems experienced by black women before, during and after childbirth” or “solutions to the challenges experienced by women of color when seeking for maternal health care.”"

"Korean Popular Culture and the Selling of Place by Youjeong Oh examines the use of K-pop music and Korean dramas with an aim to promote the rural and urban places in South Korea. To facilitate this, the book provides a framework insight on ways in which South Korea has aggressively used a number of aspects such as K-pop, K-drama, K-food, plastic surgery, and tourism to develop multiple strategies. In addition, the book expounds on the crucial relationship between urban planning and Hallyu. It uses an academic point of view to bring out the role of Korean cities through its production of television and music programs to boost their images and attract tourists. The book does so by documenting, historicizing, and using visuals to support the narrative of Korean culture.
Pop City examines that pop culture features place selling facilitated with two separate domains: Korean globalization and political centralization of Korean culture. Based on the book, the local elections put in place in the 1990s enhanced the desires among the cities to develop and promote their rural areas. A good example is Wando County, a rural village that invested approximately $8 million and used its historical sites to create a K-drama that resulted in an increase of 50 million tourists with an income of $160 million in 2008 (Oh, 2018). The same case has been used in other rural areas where they use Korean entertainment to attract foreign tourists and sponsors. The elected local leaders also portray the political dimension. The local council has the authority to pass the city and governor’s budget. With such authority and mandate, they have had the capacity to promote drama sponsorships. It means that the local government has a political centralization to dominate the decision-making process without the residents’ consent.
In addition, Pop City analyses the process of culture featured place marketing. The book illustrates that the urban spaces in Korea are produced and sold in a similar way K-pop and k-drama are promoted using spectacular images rather than using the cultural and physical qualities that are in existence. For instance, the Anseong city attempted to commodify to be featured in the television show the Baudeogi; the city invested $9 million to develop the region and ensure that the city’s cultures stand out, such as dancing, singing, acrobatics, and circus performance (Oh, 2018). The action was nullified as the locals claimed “that the spending of taxpayers’ money should be cautious, the local council, in particular, asked for a formal process to collect citizens’ extensive opinions.” (Oh, 2018). However, it is important to note that most of the K-dramas have featured different marketing regions through pseudohistory, artificial images, and fabricated representation that creates a fantasy of the reality. Hence, Pop City has demonstrated selling places through the consumer exploitative, image-based, and speculative nature of the Korean pop culture. It enhances shaping the commodification of the rural and urban regions.
Furthermore , Pop City illustrates the reasons K-pop is a popular means of entertainment globally. K-pop is popular as the production uses desirable images that create an intimacy that is appealing to the consumers; it includes visual quality, associated products, and idolized locations (Oh, 2018). It enables the consumers to create a relationship with the television show. Secondly, they use an idolized system that strongly influences K-pop. In Korea, entertainment agencies strategically produce idols who appear in films, television shows, dramas, and music. It states that “When releasing a new idol group, the gihoeksa invests a significant amount of effort in crafting unique and marketable images for it.” (Oh, 2018). The idols are used as marketing products that are used to captivate the consumer’s mind and sell the designed items such as K-pop places, music, drama show, and merchandise. The success of the idols towards the competitive market enhances profit generations.
Furthermore, the book illustrates the diverse aspects of using human geography to market Korea’s urban areas and K-pop. It defined human geography as “emotional engagement with a place turns visitors into agents of value creation on its behalf—that is, into facilitators of place selling.” (Oh, 2018). It emphasizes that for a consumer to engage with K-pop music and K-drama, the entertainment needs to be invested with the consumer’s emotions and bodily experiences. These aspects can be achieved from different places through displaying emotions of desires, love, longing, and tensions. Hence, it explains how tourists visit the K-pop music and K-drama sites to engage in an interpersonal and precognitive way, as demonstrated in the emotions of these pop. Human geography plays a significant role in pop culture, capitalizing on these emotional qualities and the way humans enact, feel, and extending their cultural involvement with the physical location.
Moreover, the book examines the extension of Hallyu disclosure through connecting with the urban placing. According to the reading, the Korean culture industry began during the existence of Hallyu due to the unanticipated global fame of the Korean culture that was led by the acquisition of the new markets. For instance, the K-drama series Jewel in the palace produced in 2003 reached over 60 countries (Oh, 2018). It impacted the industry to grow through attracting new industry players such as recording labels, entertainment management agencies, producers, and idols. It recognizes that the supply rather than the demand drives the Hallyu hype. It is because “Despite the risks involved in the oversupplied race, both the cultural producers and place marketers appear confident because of the sheer amount of uncertainty involved.” (Oh, 2018). It is also a result of increased finance channels. Since there is an oversupply of Hallyu talent, the industry tends to invest in the surplus value without producing any tangible benefits to society. For instance, K-pop takes advantage of the existing culture without investing in it.
In conclusion, Korean Popular Culture and the Selling of Place by Youjeong studies the Korean wave from a different perspective from K-food, K-pop, K-drama, fashion, tourism, and plastic surgery. All these aspects of Korean culture have enhanced the marketing and selling of Korea’s culture and locations globally. The book has enacted this by identifying that pop culture features place selling mediates through two separate domains: Korean globalization and political centralization. The political centralization is acquired through the local government having the power to promote their regions through drama sponsorships. In comparison, the globalization aspects are illustrated on the K-pop power to use their culture to earn profit and sell the place. Such reasoning and documentation of the book with supporting evidence create a well-designed, innovative, and creative reading. It is recommendable to any reader interested in the Korean culture, urban planning, and sociology of the Hallyu."
"Before the outbreak of COVID-19, Panama was one of the countries in Latin America and the Caribbean that had the strongest growth rate. Its growth performance increased at an average rate of 4.7% between 2014 and 2019 before suffering severe damage from the pandemic, leading to its labor income being reduced by 18% in 2020 (Matus et al., 2021). Panama Solidario assisted the country in maintaining its poverty rate at 14.9% instead of the estimated 18.8%, posting a rise from the initial national poverty rate, which was at 12.2% before the crisis (Matus et al., 2021). Panama’s wealth is located mainly among the high-class individuals who live in urban areas, while those who live in rural areas are six times poorer than the richer.
Globally, the unemployment rate increased drastically after the COVID-19 epidemic. Panama’s unemployment rate rose from 7.07% in 2019 to 18.55% in 2020, resulting from the damage imposed by the virus outbreak (O’Neill, 2021). In 2021, it was at 10.17%, a fall from 2020 (O’Neill, 2021). The United States had an unemployment rate of about 8.3% in 2021 (O’Neill, 2021). Comparing the two countries unemployment rates, it is vividly clear that by 2020, Panama had a higher number of the labor force that did not have jobs but were currently looking for work compared to the US. Thus, the US has most of its citizens employed, making Panama worse off.
Panama has its own official currency, known as the Panamanian Balboa. It has equal value to the dollar; in other words, one dollar is equivalent to one Panamanian Balboa. However, they do not print their paper money and instead use the dollar as their currency. This dollar adoption was due to its stability in value compared to the Balboa and its fixed exchange rate with their currency.
Panama has different trade ties with a number of countries across the globe. Its main trading partners are the US, China, Free Zones, and Singapore (Bakari & Mabrouki, 2017). The country has been attractive to foreign investors due to its stable political environment, increasing real estate market, and growing economy (Bakari & Mabrouki, 2017). Panama had a trade deficit worth 5 billion dollars in 2020, showing that the country’s imports were more than its exports. Its exports, expressed as a percentage of the GDP are at 40.74% (Matus et al., 2021). Foreign direct investment is important for a country since it creates job opportunities as investors establish new companies, reducing unemployment.
In relation to the rate of unemployment and inflation in Panama, it is evident that the country has a stable growing economy. Despite the economic shock of 2020 due to the COVID-19 crisis, the country managed to stabilize its economic growth. The Panama currency has assisted in expanding its economy because of its equality with the dollar value. Its service sector has amounted to more than 75% of the GDP, making it rise greatly in recent years, resulting from the increase in the cost of one dollar (Matus et al., 2021). It is strongly trying to revive its economy by increasing its labor force and wages."
"Chronic pain is still considered to be an extreme issue among at least 8% of the residents of progressive countries. The introduction of the study describes the apparent link between pain and demoralization. Chronic pain is always accompanied by negative emotional experiences and blocks a person’s ability to receive joy and satisfaction from life. The research investigates the development of depression and anxiety among patients receiving pharmaceutical opioids and medical marijuana (MM) as severe painkillers. It compares the efficacy of prescriptions and examines the possibility of post-treatment depression.
There is currently a severe lack of information about the effects of opiates. They manage pain successfully, but the past few decades indicated the growing concern regarding opiate abuse in forms of overdose and addiction. A more manageable and safer alternative might be medical marijuana. However, the legal status and novelty of this drug do not allow finding a large number of studies on its effectiveness. Specifically, it concerns the emotional condition of patients experiencing chronic pain. This research paper aims to analyze levels of depression and anxiety among people receiving therapy by comparing the effects of pharmaceutical opioids and MM.
The study was conducted in the form of collection and analysis of statistical data. Participants were recruited for six months at two major pain relief centers in Israel. The researchers used The Depression Module of the Patient Health Questionnaire and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale to interview participants, evaluate their answers, and conduct the study. To specifically evaluate and compare the probabilities of depression or anxiety among the diverse groups, the study used multiple logistic regression analysis and chose medical marijuana as the control group.
This type of study is the most revealing and inclusive, as it contains direct responses from a large number of participants. All tools in the form of questionnaires and scales have already been used and proved their efficacy for collecting analytical data. It helps to systematize and classify distinct kinds of information for subsequent uncomplicated services. Thus, researchers can compare the effects of medications on patients of diverse age groups, backgrounds, physical conditions, emotional states, and so on.
The analysis of any human reaction has a high potential of subjectiveness and bias, especially regarding people in severe pain and unstable emotional condition. Perhaps some patients tend to exaggerate their depressive state or vice versa, de-emphasize serious difficulties. Because the survey responses were thoroughly anonymous, the researchers were unable to carefully analyze each patient’s reaction and compare it to the actual states of condition. More accurate answers could be obtained by professional psychologists via personal communication and behavioral analysis. However, this method of research is way more resource-intensive and energy-consuming.
Participants were recruited for six months at two major pain relief centers in Israel. All patients experienced chronic pain for at least 3 months. The study included 890 participants, of which 474 (59%) were treated solely with opioids, 329 (41%) were treated with MM, and 77 (8.6%) acquired both (Feingold et al., 2017). The remaining ten participants who did not receive pharmaceutical opioids and medical marijuana were withdrawn from the analysis in the research. Therefore, it is not possible to comprehensively compare patients taking medications with those who do not.
The study conducted a correlation type of research with variable measures. It evaluated the interdependence of various factors that affected the physical and emotional condition of patients experiencing chronic pain. For example, the survey showed that the ratio of female patients was remarkably higher in the opiates group compared to the MM group. In turn, people on opiates were more likely to report major depressive disorders.
The questionnaires used different variable measures to collect information. For example, it included comprehensive socio-demographic data: gender, age, country, type of residence (urban/rural), years of education, and employment status. Patients were also asked about their medical history over the years and the current presence of any severe diseases such as heart failure, diabetes, arthritis, and so on. The third measure of the questionnaire was indicated by information on any twelve-month and lifetime drug and alcohol consumption. In addition, the record included a pain measurement scale from 0 to 10 to evaluate discomfort feelings during the last month.
Among all participants in the study, 42.2% suffered from depression, and 37% experienced excessive anxiety. The plurality of depressive disorders among patients in the opiates, medical marijuana, and mixed OPMM groups numbered 57.1%, 22.3%, and 51.4%, respectively. The plurality of anxiety contained 48.4% among OP patients, 21.5% among MM patients, and 38.7% among OPMM participants. Patients who took strong opiates were tended to place their pain on a scale of 9 to 10 (Feingold et al., 2017). They were also anguished emotionally and reacted radically negatively to almost all survey questions. Patients who took only MM or mixed medications course had a significantly more stable emotional state and coped with pain more manageable.
One of the major limitations is the insufficiently high response rate, 57% instead of 70% (Feingold et al., 2017). It can be fairly explained by the weak focus of respondents who have overcome severe pain sensations and depressive episodes. It is not clear how to use these statistics, as they still may be relevant for the overall analysis."

"Major League Baseball (MLB) player Tyler Skaggs died several years ago. He was found in his team hotel room in Texas, choking on his vomit, on July 1, 2019 (Wagner, 2021). The main cause of death was ruled as “an intoxication from the substances,” including fentanyl, oxycodone, and alcohol (Wagner, 2021, para. 8). Fentanyl is a fast-acting opioid, which is 50-100 times more powerful than morphine and 30-50 times than heroin (Han et al., 2019). This opioid drug is frequently used in medicine to manage severe pain in cancer patients and perioperative pain. However, it is also used outside of clinical settings and often leads to fatal overdoses. The case of Tyler Skaggs serves as a reminder of the problem that is crucial in the United States nowadays – the opioid crisis.
The opioid-related deaths are not new, and one of their reasons is illicitly produced and distributed opioid drugs. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is responsible for reducing “the Aggregate Production Quota (APQ) of opioids each year since 2017” (Schatman & Wegrzyn, 2020, p. 2629). According to the DEA’s 2020 report, the “total domestic opioid production has decreased by 53% since 2016” (Schatman & Wegrzyn, 2020, p. 2629). Still, the number of deaths from opioid overdose continues to increase, and Skaggs’s death is one such case. Since the baseball player did not receive the drugs from his doctor, the DEA began to investigate his overdose-death in general and the source of the drugs in particular.
The DEA is responsible for the health and safety of American communities and neighborhoods. That is why the organization is involved in investigating Skaggs’s death. The main goals of the DEA are to identify and affect the sources of illicit drugs and reduce drug-related violence (DEA, 2021). Moreover, it aims to assist and contribute to local drug use prevention activities and bring justice to the families of persons who died because they did not know what drugs they used (Nishida, 2021). Thus, the DEA created the Overdose Justice Task Force to investigate opioid-related deaths, most of which were caused by fentanyl (Nishida, 2021). Since Skaggs’s death was also caused by fentanyl overdose, the DEA interfered with his case and started its investigation.
When it is clear why the DEA is involved in Skaggs’s death investigation, it is still unclear how it is involved. Thus, federal law enforcement agents interviewed other team members, friends, and relatives of the victim, trying to discover how the man obtained the drug. The investigation showed that fentanyl was detected everywhere, “even in marijuana” (Quinn, 2019, para. 5). Thus, the DEA started its cooperation with law enforcement to reduce domestic opioid production and drug-related deaths. The organization’s investigation led to Eric Kay, who worked in the communication department of the baseball team where Skaggs played. The man was charged for supplying Skaggs counterfeit drugs with fentanyl that caused the player’s death and distributing oxycodone and fentanyl since at least 2017 (Castillo, 2022). Although Kay’s fault has not yet been proven, the DEA’s contribution to this investigation is significant.
Skaggs’s death is a reminder of the existing opioid crisis in the U.S. This case demonstrates that the opioid epidemic is a societal problem associated with governmental blindness and unwillingness or inability to solve this issue. According to Fischer et al. (2020), illicitly produced and distributed synthetic opioid drugs, including fentanyl, have appeared during the last five years. They are distributed as counterfeit prescriptions along with other medications. Therefore, neither consumers nor law enforcement can detect the source of such drugs. For this reason, the number of opioid-related deaths in the United States has increased by 300% between 2013 and 2017 (Fischer et al., 2020). Most opioid-related deaths involve fentanyl, which is why the current drug crisis is identified as a “fentanyl epidemic” (Fischer et al., 2020, p. 2). The U.S. government needs to understand the supply process and reveal illicit drug markets and producers to address this problem.
One can see that the opioid crisis is a societal problem, and the whole society should try to address it. Thus, in Skaggs’s case, friends and relatives did not report any drug-related issues before Tyler’s death. Moreover, MLB had never tested its players on opioid use before that case, and it agreed to add this testing to the drug policy only five months after Skaggs’s death (Castillo, 2022). The questions arise: why did not MLB address this issue earlier? Is it possible that no one noticed that Skaggs suffered from pain and needed painkillers? Further research is required in order to answer these questions and find the guilty for Skaggs’s death.
The opioid epidemic is a national problem that needs to be managed immediately. Nowadays, people have open access to prescribed and illicit opioid products, leading to misuse, overdose, and even death. If the DEA wants to change the situation, it should cooperate with law enforcement and offer stricter regulations and control of opioid drug prescriptions. Moreover, state and federal government agencies and health organizations should also address this epidemic, improving the existing rules and policies and emphasizing pain prevention, not just treatment. Finally, synthetic illegal opioid drugs entering the United States from outside markets should be eliminated."
"The author is JK McKnight, who created Art of Impact to genuinely engage Gen Z and millennials by positively impacting their lives and communities. He founded the Forecastle Festival, a three-day celebration of music, art, and environmental activity. The article was published on December 3, 2021, on Lane Report, a website that specializes in business news (McKnight, 2021). The paper’s target audience is employers interested in having Gen Z and millennials working for them. McKnight wrote the article when most workers were leaving jobs they could not enjoy. At the same time, the pandemic situation contributed to this because when employees returned from isolation, they felt exhausted and dissatisfied with their careers (McKnight, 2021). This factor caused most of the workers, especially Gen Z and Millennials, to begin searching for jobs where they could satisfy their desires.
It is significant to mention that the purpose of the article is to inform employers about which factors can encourage the younger generation to work for their company. McKnight has also included some essential advice that is beneficial to recruiters. The author’s central thesis is that there are changes in the workplace now, and successful employers should conform to the major trends in order to retain workers (McKnight, 2021). The article completely achieves the purpose of informing employers of the processes and steps that need to be implemented to ensure that work satisfies the expectations and desires of employees."
"Introduction (70 words):
The impact of media sources on the public's perception of crime and its relation to social and political ideologies cannot be underestimated. This essay delves into the extent to which media sources shape these perceptions, highlighting the power they yield in constructing narratives and influencing public opinion. By analyzing various examples and drawing evidence from reputable sources, this essay aims to shed light on the significant role media plays in shaping public understanding of crime and its broader implications within society.
Main Body (260 words):
Media sources, including print, broadcast, and digital platforms, play a pivotal role in shaping the public's perception of crime. They have the ability to construct narratives that reinforce or challenge particular social and political ideologies, ultimately shaping how the public interprets criminal activities and their broader significance. Media outlets often sensationalize crime stories, emphasizing dramatic and violent incidents while neglecting other essential aspects of the criminal justice system. This selective reporting creates an exaggerated perception of crime rates, leading to fear and anxiety among the public.
For instance, Mass Shooting Tracker, an independent database, reveals that the number of mass shootings in the United States reported by the media is significantly higher than what official data indicates. Such misleading reporting can perpetuate an unfounded fear among citizens, creating a demand for stricter gun control policies without considering other underlying factors contributing to the issue. Consequently, media sources essentially shape public perceptions and influence political ideologies related to firearms and control measures.
Furthermore, media sources contribute to the stigmatization and racial profiling of various communities by associating particular crimes with specific ethnic or social groups. A study conducted by Chiricos et al. (2004) found that the media frequently link crime to minority groups, reinforcing societal prejudices. This skewed portrayal distorts the public's understanding of crime, fosters discriminatory attitudes, and perpetuates social and political ideologies that marginalize certain communities.
Contrary to this, media sources can also challenge prevailing narratives and ideologies by shedding light on systemic issues and social inequalities relating to crime. By drawing attention to socioeconomic disparities, inadequate access to education, and limited employment opportunities, media can spark critical conversations and prompt societal changes. In the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement, media coverage and citizen journalism exposed police brutality against marginalized communities, leading to widespread outrage and calls for reform.
Conclusion (70 words):
In conclusion, media sources wield a significant influence on the public's perception of crime and its relation to social and political ideologies. By selectively reporting, sensationalizing, or omitting key information, media can shape public understanding and create anxiety or bias. Nevertheless, media also possesses the potential to challenge prevailing narratives, highlight social inequalities, and foster meaningful conversations about crime and its broader implications. Recognizing this power is crucial for consumers of news, who should seek diverse and reliable sources to develop a more balanced and informed perspective on crime in society."
"The adversarial criminal justice system is one where the law is applied equally to all segments of the society. It is a system that presumes that one is innocent that shifts the burden of proof to the prosecution to prove beyond any shadow of a doubt. The advantage lies on the side of the defendant if there is any doubt. The accused is granted the right to silence and cannot be forced to respond to accusation levelled against them.
This system poses some ethical problems because most of its procedural safeguards are always in favour of the accused. The favours that are granted to the accused include the right of appeal, the right to remain silent, the right to have an attorney, and the right to be free from unauthorized searches and arrests. The rights granted to the defendant are always a disadvantage to the prosecution which has to prove its case against the accused. This position is biased against the prosecution and makes its work even more difficult. The system encourages a scenario where both entities to a case contest with each other to win a case. This scenario makes it easier vulnerable to acts of deception and legal tactics that are questionable instead of using facts to settle cases. It is a potential ethical problem that can be solved by allowing both parties to present facts before any judgment is made to avoid injustices.
If a black man is found committing a similar offence like a white woman, he is five times more likely to be arrested. It is a tendency that has been brought about by racism in the American judicial system and racial inequality in policing. Moreover, the black man is more likely to be convicted than a white woman who has committed a similar crime. According to a report by the United States Sentencing Commission, a black man who is found the same crime as the white man have a potential of receiving nearly 20% longer prison term (Ingraham, 2017). These disparities are due to cases of racism and bias found within the American criminal justice system."
"Globalization is the extent to which information, investments, trade, political cooperation, cultural values, and social ideas flow among different countries. It is creating a borderless world for managers by allowing them to conduct their operations internationally rather than locally, hire employees from different countries, buy raw materials from the best sources, and sell goods in various markets (Samson et al., 2020). Although the borderless world presents many opportunities to managers, it also entails risks, such as information security and cultural differences.
A global mindset is a manager’s ability to recognize and influence people or organizations that have different cultural, social, political, and psychological backgrounds (Samson et al., 2020). It has become imperative for international companies because managers constantly interact with individuals with different perspectives. To ensure effective operations and collaboration, managers should be able to understand these perspectives instead of sticking to a worldview prevalent in their home country.
The international landscape is changing since China, India, and Brazil demonstrate economic growth and play an important role in global business. For example, China has received more foreign investments than any other place and has increased its number of Fortune Global 500 companies from 16 in 2005 to 98 in 2015 (Samson et al., 2020). While China is growing through manufacturing, India develops economically through services, software design, and precision engineering.
A multinational corporation (MNC) is a company, with more than 25% of revenues which come from operations in countries other than the home country of the parent organization (Samson et al., 2020). MNCs are characterized by close cooperation among affiliates in different countries and a single management authority making key decisions for the parent company and all affiliates (Samson et al., 2020). Additionally, MNC managers have a global perspective, viewing the whole world as one market.
Outsourcing refers to participating in a global division of labor that enables companies to complete certain activities in locations with the cheapest raw materials and labor (Samson et al., 2020). Exporting is an entry strategy in which the company’s production facilities remain in the home country, while produced goods are transferred to other countries for sale. Licensing is an entry strategy in which the company in one country gives firms in other countries access to specific resources, such as technology or trademark rights, to produce and sell its products abroad (Samson et al., 2020). Direct investing is an entry strategy where the company manages its production facilities in another country."
"The study showed that bibliometric analysis of evidence gathered from integrative reviews and analytical studies had substantial implications for nurse-related and evidence based policy changes. Primarily, this is possible through the use of integrative reviews in designing new programs (Benton et al., 2020). The collective database of the synthesized studies as suggested by the authors of the study, can be utilized by nurses to be empowered through evidence-based materials in the formulation of changes in universal health coverage. As such, the applicability of this information has a number of benefits for working nurses, as they will be able to employ concise and trusted resources when advocating or implementing changes to policy. I think that nursing practice can be vastly improved with the use of well-managed databases that employ evidence-based research. This is because such a database will be able to illustrate gaps in knowledge of overarching issues as well as daily medical practices in the sphere of nursing (Houser, 2016). Similarly, it allows for insight into nurse-specific fields such as nurse education, care for the lederly, emergency care, and more.
Currently, accessibility to extensive and complete information that is formed through evidence-based research is limited due to a number of factors. In order to better provide such informative materials among working nurses it is essential to reduce bureaucratic processes and integrate technology into the process. Modern technology allows for low-cost and time-saving methods of information sharing, which will be largely beneficial for nursing. As mentioned prior, evidence-based research has the potential to reveal gaps in information in nurse-specific practices that would otherwise be unseen. I believe it is essential to make such knowledge accesibile and cohesive to promote better nursing care and work quality."

"The end of childhood and the overall period of adolescence are complex concepts fraught with complications, and these intricacies have a profound impact on the legal framework surrounding young populations. Defining the end of childhood is particularly challenging as it is not a quantifiable milestone but rather a nuanced transition influenced by a myriad of social, biological, and cultural factors.
Biologically, adolescence marks the onset of puberty, characterized by the physical and sexual maturation of an individual. However, the mental, emotional, and cognitive development that accompanies this period is equally crucial. Societal expectations also shape the age at which childhood supposedly ends, with variations across cultures and historical periods. Consequently, pinpointing a specific age as the end of childhood becomes problematic, as each individual may mature at different rates and face distinct life circumstances.
These complications significantly impact the legal framework for young populations. Laws intended to protect children often define the age of majority, limiting certain rights and responsibilities until individuals reach a specific age. However, an arbitrary cutoff age fails to account for the vast differences in maturity and capacities among adolescents. As a result, legal systems must grapple with the challenge of determining when young people can be trusted with certain rights while also safeguarding their well-being.
Furthermore, the evolving understanding of adolescence requires legal frameworks to adapt and incorporate a more comprehensive view of young people's capabilities and vulnerabilities. Adolescents exhibit significant cognitive development, yet their decision-making capacities may still be developing. This dynamic tension between autonomy and protection poses dilemmas for lawmakers. Balancing the need to empower young populations with the imperative to shield them from potential harm is a delicate task.
Additionally, the impact of defining the end of childhood transcends legal boundaries, straining social, educational, and healthcare systems. Schools need to provide age-appropriate education and support services that recognize the diverse needs and experiences of adolescents. Healthcare practitioners must address the physical and psychological changes unique to this period. Societal expectations and cultural norms further complicate matters, as they shape the experiences and opportunities available to young people.
In conclusion, defining the end of childhood and adolescence is a complex undertaking affected by various interrelated factors. The subjective nature of this transition poses significant challenges for the legal framework governing young populations. The law must strive to strike a balance between acknowledging individual differences in maturity and safeguarding the well-being of young people. As our understanding of adolescence continues to evolve, it is imperative that legal systems adapt to better support and protect the rights and interests of young populations."

According to the legend, the idea of the Act originated when the Congresswoman was interrupted by a loud TV commercial during the family dinner. After the CALM Act of 2012 was enforced, the number of complaints began to gradually decrease, however it never ended. This is because the law was not perfect, and there were ways to bypass the loudness limitation while still airing a loud commercial. With the COVID-19 pandemic, people began to spend more time watching TV, and the number of complaints increased by 140 percent, which is evidence of the Act’s mixed results (Yang et al., 2021). Most of it is attributed to the alternative ways of saturating the sound of the audio track, such as compressing, which makes the quiet frequencies louder without increasing the overall level of loudness of the mix."

"The Black Death, a devastating pandemic that swept through Europe during the 14th century, had a profound impact on medieval culture. Social-economic dynamics were drastically altered as the labor force dramatically decreased, leading to a shortage of workers that resulted in higher wages and improved living conditions for survivors. Moreover, the decimation of the population caused a shift in land ownership, empowering peasants and serfs who previously were bound to the feudal system.
Medical practices were greatly affected as well. The lack of understanding about the disease led to ineffective methods of treatment, such as bloodletting and suppurating buboes. However, the Black Death ultimately sparked advancements in medicine, encouraging the study of anatomy and infectious diseases.
The church, which held immense power during medieval times, faced a crisis of faith as the plague consumed the faithful. Many questioned why a benevolent God would allow such suffering, leading to a decline in faith and a rise in skepticism towards religious authority.
Literacy levels were considerably impacted. With a high mortality rate among the educated elite, the availability of academic resources diminished. Consequently, the importance of oral tradition and local knowledge increased, shifting the mode of learning and passing down information.
Gender roles experienced a transformation as well. As men and women shared the burden of caring for the sick, their roles became slightly more equalized. Additionally, the high mortality rate among men opened up opportunities for women to take on traditionally male-dominated jobs, challenging societal norms.
Finally, the Black Death forced society to reevaluate its moral standards. The sheer devastation caused individuals to question the meaning of life and pursue personal fulfillment. This resulted in a shift away from strict religious morality towards a more individualistic perspective.
Overall, the Black Death left an indelible mark on medieval culture, influencing social-economic dynamics, medical practices, the influence of the church, literacy levels, gender roles, and the moral standards imposed by society. Its impact can still be felt today, shaping the trajectory of European history."

"An initial reaction rate is an instant rate at the beginning of the response. The graph has the y and x-axis, y stands for the concentration of moles per liter, and x stands for time in seconds. In this case, the chemical reaction is going against time; at the beginning of the response, the chemical concentration is very high, hence considered a positive reaction. As time goes by, the slope decreases, giving a negative curve; therefore, the reactant concentration reduces within an interval of time.
Instantaneous rate is an instant rate in time with differential rate, the reactant against time. The instant calculation is by determining the negativity of the slope and the curve for the concentration of the moles per liter against time in seconds (Du et al., 2021 p 3154). Rate is equal to the negativity of the slope over time in seconds; this brings the instant rate and the difference between them, which gives the instantaneous rate.
The reaction rate calculates the average over a time interval by dividing the moles’ concentration change per liter overtime per seconds’ period by time interval. Getting average is by observing the difference in the reactant’s concentration using the equation where the brackets mean the attention of the reactant. A minus sign applies when the rate is of a positive number from the previous equation. Nevertheless, the minus sign is not needed to calculate the used products’ average rates. Getting the average from B to G is by adding all the concentration intervals and dividing them from B to G to get the standard. To conclude, at the beginning of the reaction at point A and time 0, the concentration of moles per liter was high, while at point G, the engagement was low."
"It is important to note that the decision-making process is a complex and highly intricate activity, which involves the accuracy of the information, a clear vision of objectives, and an understanding of the underlying issues. Errors in the decision-making process are common and can be done by any manager. However, there is a clear distinction between a bad decision and a wrong decision. In the case of the latter, the decision is the result of reliance on false or inaccurate information with the best intentions to make a correct choice. When it comes to a bad decision, a manager is aware of and has accurate information and a proper understanding of key factors but intentionally chooses the incorrect path. A bad decision might occur due to a wide range of factors, which can involve a conflict between a manager’s self-interests and organizational objectives or merely emotional influence on the decision-making. However, wrong decisions require changes in the acquisition of accurate and reliable information on which the correct decision can be made.
In both cases, it is highly relevant to improve one’s decision-making skills both now and in the future. Such an improvement requires an increase in the integrity of processes of data acquisition and collection. It is stated that decisions can be “impaired by various inconsistencies and errors, which negatively affect the value of these data for any decision-making processes” (Schuh et al., 2017, p. 425). Therefore, proper automation of data collection methods on the basis of accuracy and integrity can greatly improve the overall knowledge available to a manager. By being able to see a wider and clearer picture of a situation, a manager will be capable of making correct decisions."
"Introduction
The study of philosophy boosts a person’s problem-solving skills and opens one’s imagination to aspects of life beyond material science. Philosophical skills allow scholars to examine ideas, definitions, arguments, and issues that directly affect the perception of life (Blanshard 12). Such skills add to the ability to organize thoughts and concerns, cope with matters of worth, and extract what is vital from vast volumes of information. Through its demands on intellectual engagement, philosophy contributes significantly to the educational endeavor. This essay is based on the theme that philosophy is crucial as it opens the scholar’s mind in higher education to world views on thought frequency, vibration, and energy. In higher education, philosophy entails becoming acquainted with significant figures and improvements in antiquity, mastering current techniques, and accepting philosophical issues. Exposure to the concepts in philosophy helps scholars develop critical, analytic, and observational abilities that may be considered the most valuable in the greater scheme of life.
Fundamental Traits of a Philosopher
Philosophy makes a critical contribution to achieving four criteria that should be foundational to any institute of higher learning. The foundational skills include instilling basic thought patterns in students and improving their text interpretation, writing, and good communication skills. These skills are essential in developing cultural identities and encouraging scholars to engage critical questions about reality, knowledge, and relevance (Rick 583). Specific fundamental traits make a scholar a good philosopher ready to engage in constructive arguments that shape decisions in daily life. The most common characteristics include open-mindedness, skepticism, and a systemic thinking approach.
Open-Mindedness
Open-mindedness is one of the important that s that define a scholar as a philosopher. Open-mindedness is better understood as a predisposition rather than an occurrence. Open-mindedness is not about one’s honest opinions but about one’s willingness to revise them under suitable conditions. It requires genuine humility in the face of admitted fallibility and adjusting the perception of existing problems (Blanshard 32). Open-mindedness is a constructive virtue in a philosophical framework. It acts as a correction to confirmation bias, an epistemic fault. In this context, open-mindedness is the epistemically virtuous inclination to resist the detrimental consequences of confirmation bias on our capacity to reason correctly and analyze facts and arguments.
Skepticism
A good philosopher is also supposed to have some levels of skepticism that provide for more research invalidating the information provided in a discussion. Skepticism is the attitude of disputing knowledge claims made in several fields of Western philosophy (Rick 571). Skeptics have questioned the sufficiency or dependability of these statements by inquiring about the principles upon which they are founded or what they genuinely establish. A critical mindset will aid the scholar in requiring a rationale for the ethical claims of others. Additionally, the scholar will eschew appeals to authority in favor of considering all perspectives.
Systemic Approach to Thinking
A good paradigmatic philosopher must also show signs of systemic thinking in their approach to issues in life. Consistent with systems philosophy, systems thinking is concerned with comprehending a system by examining the relationships and interactions between the system’s constituent pieces. Systems thinking is especially beneficial when confronted with complicated or wicked problems (Blanshard 12). In philosophy, systems thinking better predicts future outcomes based on a deeper grasp of the surrounding structure and its constituents than on previous occurrences. A few philosophers have demonstrated some of these trains, including Socrates, a Greek philosopher from Athens credited with establishing Western philosophy.
Argumentative Case for Socrates
Socrates emerges as a paradigmatic scholar who understands philosophy as applying logic and reason to pursue knowledge. According to Socrates, such knowledge may be gained by contact with the surrounding (Blanshard 22). Socrates established that philosophy is concerned with the topic of investigation, even though such a study seldom understands the subject. Plato’s Socratic dialogues demonstrate that philosophy is a process of self-examination, examination of other aspects of life, and recognition of known limitations."
"Contracts are an essential component of everyday life, shaping the business world and personal relationships alike. In order to understand the intricacies of contracts, it is paramount to discuss their classification, types, essential conditions, and characteristics. Moreover, the concept and significance of option contracts within the context of making and concluding transactions should be explored. Additionally, it is crucial to comprehend how the absence of essential conditions can affect the validity of a contract, while delving into the legal implications of fraud in contract agreements based on the US Code of Federal Law.
Classification of contracts is based on various criteria, including their formation, performance, and enforceability. Accordingly, contracts can be categorized as unilateral, bilateral, express, or implied. Unilateral contracts arise when one party promises an action in exchange for a performance by the other party. On the other hand, bilateral contracts manifest when both parties make promises to each other. Express contracts are those in which parties explicitly state their intentions, while implied contracts arise from the conduct rather than explicit agreements.
Types of contracts further determine the subject matter and purpose of the agreement. Common types include sales contracts, lease agreements, employment contracts, and service contracts. Sales contracts involve the transfer of ownership of goods, while lease agreements govern the temporary possession and use of property. Employment contracts establish a mutually binding relationship between an employer and an employee, outlining rights and obligations. Service contracts govern services provided, setting forth expectations and compensations.
Essential conditions and characteristics of contracts are vital for their validity and enforceability. These conditions include offer and acceptance, consideration, capacity, legality, and intention to create legal relations. An offer is a proposal made by one party which, when accepted, forms a contract. Acceptance, in contrast, is the agreement to the terms of the offer. Consideration involves something of value being exchanged, such as money, goods, or services. Capacity refers to the legal ability of parties to enter into a contract, while legality ensures that contracts are not formed for illegal activities. Lastly, the intention to create legal relations ensures that parties genuinely intend to be legally bound by their agreement.
Option contracts hold substantial significance within the realm of transactions. These contracts grant one party the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specific asset at a predetermined price within a certain time frame. The party purchasing the option pays a premium to the seller, granting them the choice to exercise the option or let it expire. This mechanism allows individuals and businesses to protect themselves against potential fluctuations in prices or unforeseen events, providing flexibility and strategic advantage.
The absence of essential conditions can significantly impact the validity of a contract. If any of these conditions are not met, a contract may be deemed void or voidable. For instance, if one party lacks capacity to enter into a contract, such as being a minor or mentally incapacitated, the contract can be voided. Similarly, if a contract breaches legal statutes or public policies, it might be declared unenforceable. Furthermore, if fraud or misrepresentation occurs during the formation of a contract and a party is induced into an agreement based on false information, the contract can be rescinded.
Fraud in contract agreements carries serious legal implications according to the US Code of Federal Law. It encompasses intentional misrepresentation or concealment of material facts by a party, resulting in injury to the other party. If fraud is proven, the deceived party has the right to rescind the contract, seek damages, or pursue other legal remedies. Fraudulent behavior not only undermines the essence of a contract but also erodes trust and fairness in business dealings. Consequently, the law seeks to protect parties from fraudulent practices and preserve the integrity of contracts.
In conclusion, contracts play a pivotal role in our daily lives by facilitating transactions and shaping relationships. Understanding the classification and types of contracts, along with their essential conditions and characteristics, is crucial for their formation and enforcement. Option contracts provide flexibility and strategic advantages in transactions. Furthermore, the absence of essential conditions can impact the validity of contracts, rendering them void or voidable. The legal implications of fraud in contract agreements under the US Code of Federal Law are severe, serving to protect parties from fraudulent practices and preserve the integrity of contractual obligations."
"Introduction:
Constitutions are the foundational documents that protect the rights and liberties of individuals within a particular jurisdiction. The United States Constitution's Bill of Rights serves as a benchmark for constitutional rights worldwide. In this essay, we will explore the correspondence between Article I of the Florida Constitution and the U.S. Constitution's Bill of Rights, with specific emphasis on religious freedom, rights of the accused and of victims, and the right to privacy. By analyzing this correspondence, we can gain a deeper understanding of how Florida incorporates and expands upon the rights enshrined in the federal Constitution.
Religious Freedom:
Religious freedom is a fundamental aspect of any democratic society, as it guarantees the liberty of individuals to practice their faith without fear of repression or discrimination. Both Article I of the Florida Constitution and the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment guarantee this freedom. However, the Florida Constitution offers additional protections, specifically in Section 3 of Article I, which explicitly prohibits discrimination on the basis of religious belief or heritage. This provision ensures that religious groups and individuals are afforded equal protection under the law, thereby promoting a more inclusive society.
Rights of the Accused and of Victims:
The rights of the accused and of the victims are essential components of a fair and just legal system. Article I, Section 16 of the Florida Constitution closely mirrors the U.S. Constitution's Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments, ensuring that individuals facing legal charges are guaranteed due process, protection against self-incrimination, the right to a fair trial, and protection against cruel and unusual punishment. However, the Florida Constitution offers some additional safeguards, such as Article I, Section 16(b), which extends the right of victims to be informed, present, and heard during the criminal justice process.
Furthermore, Article I, Section 16(c), known as ""Marsy's Law,"" added by voter referendum in 2018, grants crime victims additional constitutional rights. This amendment entitles victims to timely notification of any proceedings that may affect their rights, as well as meaningful participation throughout the criminal justice process. By codifying these enhanced rights, Florida sets an example for other states in prioritizing the needs and participation of victims within the legal framework.
Right of Privacy:
The right to privacy is a fundamental right that has evolved over time and gained recognition through judicial interpretations. While the U.S. Constitution does not explicitly mention a right to privacy, the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized it as an inherent element of the Bill of Rights. Article I, Section 23 of the Florida Constitution explicitly guarantees this right, offering additional protection to its citizens. This provision safeguards against unwarranted intrusion into individuals' private lives, ensuring their personal autonomy and freedom from unnecessary government interference. Florida's explicit recognition of this right highlights the state's commitment to protecting individual privacy in a rapidly evolving digital age.
Conclusion:
In analyzing the correspondence between Article I of the Florida Constitution and the U.S. Constitution's Bill of Rights, it becomes evident that Florida not only embraces the fundamental rights enshrined in the federal Constitution but also expands upon them. Florida's Constitution provides enhanced protections for religious freedom, comprehensive rights for both the accused and victims within the criminal justice system, and a clear constitutional right to privacy. These additional safeguards demonstrate Florida's commitment to preserving and advancing individual liberties.
By continuously affirming and expanding constitutional rights, Florida fosters an inclusive and fair society that champions religious freedom, safeguards the rights of all individuals involved in the criminal justice system, and protects personal privacy. Through this analysis, we recognize the vital role state constitutions play in upholding and complementing the rights provided by the federal Constitution. It is through this dialogue between federal and state constitutional law that our collective commitment to individual rights and liberties is strengthened and upheld."
"The correctional and prison system of the US is a hot topic for discussion in modern times. Being one of the most common topics for political manipulation and populist claims, the criminal justice system has become heavily ineffective. According to Harvard Political Review, the US has a shocking 76.6% of prisoners who returned to prison within five years (Benecchi, 2021). This essay aims to show the alternative way of dealing with the correctional system proposed by Brandon Matthews. This concept requires the split between two different tracks of punishment and rehabilitation with the goal of breaking the false link between these two processes.
The true nature of the modern American prison system is that it takes its roots in the tradition of punishment. From the ancient Code of Hammurabi to the harsh ways of the death penalty in the 19th century, there was an evolution of practice that the response to violations of law should be strict (TEDx Talks, 2017). As a result, the idea of punishment has become the core aspect of the US correctional system (Carter, n.d.). Brandon Matthews argues that to change the existing state of affairs, there is a need to draw the line between punishment and rehabilitation (TEDx Talks, 2017). In a true sense, punishment requiring a “strict prison environment” should be directed towards criminals who committed serious crimes and used high levels of violence (TEDx Talks, 2017, 5:30). In contrast, people responsible for non-violent crimes should follow the rehabilitation track (TEDx Talks, 2017). Notably, only with the break from the punishment nature of modern prisons can it be effective.
However, such prison philosophy can cause criticism and opposition from the relatively high proportion of people, especially those who work in the correctional system. Brandon Matthews told the story when he spoke with a correctional staff member about the practice of rehabilitation, she responded that “they [prisoners] are inmates, not patients” (TEDx Talks, 2017, 9:59). It is evident that combining punishment and rehabilitation in one place does not work correctly. The work with inmates of serious misconduct requires a distinctive type of morality, while the practice in rehabilitation centers demands less strict relationships. In reality, prisoners are true patients whose criminality should be cured before they reenter the communities.
In my opinion, the model described by Brandon Matthews is truly legitimate and effective. There is no reason to punish inmates who committed nonviolent crimes with prisons’ strict and demoralizing atmosphere. The primary concern is how this reform will go through the legislature. Evidently, this reform will face the criticism of conservative politicians, who are biased toward any kind of offenders. What is more, the negative attitude toward any prisoners among Americans is also widespread. For example, it is clearly seen how Internet users severely criticize the prison conditions of Anders Breivik, the cruel terrorist who killed 77 people. He has relatively comfortable living conditions in a Norwegian prison, the quality of which may be better than someone’s in the US. Thus, there is a need to change some people’s perceptions about the prisoners and publicly insist on the high value of the rehabilitation process.
To sum up, professionals should address an apparent problem of the ineffectiveness of the modern American prison system. The high recidivism rate bothers all Americans, so new and new ideas about the radical reforms mushroom. Brandon Matthews presented the model of drawing the definite line between punishment and rehabilitation. These two ways of the correctional system’s operation should be independent. By distinguishing rehabilitation, the professionals will have the ability to change prisoners’ morality and prepare them for everyday life after the release from prison."
"Introduction:
In recent times, the question of the extent to which a company should be held responsible for injuries sustained by skiers on their slopes has become an increasingly debated topic. This essay aims to explore the case of Mr. Craig and Mr. Alex, who were injured while skiing on a closed slope, and evaluate the actions of the company's workers and their role in creating risks for the skiers. Additionally, it will delve into the responsibility of the company, the skiers themselves, and the individuals involved in sending Mr. Alex to an untested slope without an instructor. The severity of Mr. Alex's injuries, the length of his recovery period, and the need for compensation will be analyzed. Furthermore, the inherent nature of skiing as a traumatic sport and the responsibilities of skiers in being aware of potential risks will also be considered.
Body:
1. Assessing the responsibility of the company:
The company, as the owner and operator of the slopes, has a duty to ensure the safety of skiers. This includes maintaining safe skiing conditions, closing hazardous slopes, and adequately training their staff to prevent accidents. By allowing Mr. Craig and Mr. Alex to access a closed slope, the company failed to fulfill this duty and should be held responsible for the resulting injuries.
2. Evaluating the behavior of the company's workers:
The actions of the company's workers play a crucial role in creating or mitigating risks for skiers. Their failure to adequately monitor and enforce slope closures contributed directly to the incident. Thus, the workers' negligence warrants scrutiny and implies a shared responsibility between the company and its employees.
3. Responsibility of the skiers:
While the company holds a significant responsibility, skiers also bear responsibility for their safety. Skiers should be aware of the potential risks associated with the sport, including skiing on closed slopes, and exercise caution accordingly. Therefore, Mr. Craig and Mr. Alex should have recognized the risks associated with entering a closed slope and made an informed decision based on safety considerations.
4. The role of individuals who sent Mr. Alex to the untested slope without an instructor:
Individuals who knowingly sent Mr. Alex to the untested slope without an instructor present are also accountable for the resulting injuries. This failure to prioritize safety and provide proper guidance indicates a disregard for the skier's well-being, adding another layer to the responsible parties.
5. Considering the severity of injuries, recovery period, and the need for compensation:
The severity of Mr. Alex's injuries and the length of his recovery period must be taken into account when determining the extent of compensation owed. Permanent injuries or prolonged physical and emotional suffering justify increased compensation, acknowledging the impact on the affected individual's life.
6. The nature of skiing and skiers' awareness of risks:
Skiing is inherently a traumatic sport involving inherent risks, including collisions, falls, and variable weather conditions. Skiers have a responsibility to educate themselves about these risks, adhere to safety guidelines, and make informed decisions regarding their participation. While companies have obligations to mitigate risks, skiers must also accept personal responsibility for their actions.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, the extent to which a company should be held responsible for injuries sustained by skiers on their slopes is a complex issue that requires a careful analysis of the circumstances. The case of Mr. Craig and Mr. Alex highlights the shared responsibility between the company, its workers, the skiers themselves, and the individuals involved in their care. Ultimately, striking a balance that acknowledges each party's contribution to the incident, including the severity of injuries, recovery period, and the inherent risks of the sport, is crucial when holding a company accountable for skier injuries."
"Introduction:
The introduction of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) brought about a significant shift in the healthcare landscape. This essay will discuss the challenges that Asian Health Services (AHS), an organization dedicated to providing healthcare services to the Asian population, faced in response to the ACA. Furthermore, it will evaluate how the organization adapted to overcome these challenges and explore the remaining issues that need to be addressed for AHS to improve its current outputs and resolve emerging complications. Additionally, we will consider the importance of mission, vision, and values statements in guiding AHS's strategic plan and their impact on external factors.
Challenges faced by Asian Health Services (AHS) due to the ACA:
1. Funding Constraints: AHS faced financial challenges stemming from Medicaid reimbursement cuts and the establishment of state insurance marketplaces. These changes created uncertainty about the organization's revenue streams and budgetary planning.
2. Increased Demand and Patient Influx: The ACA led to an increase in the number of insured individuals seeking healthcare services. AHS experienced an overwhelming demand for its culturally sensitive care, leading to longer wait times, patient dissatisfaction, and resource shortages.
3. Language and Cultural Barriers: AHS provides care to a diverse Asian population with varying cultural backgrounds and limited English proficiency. The ACA's increased patient volume exacerbated the existing language and cultural barriers, making it more challenging to deliver appropriate care and maintain patient satisfaction.
Adaptation strategies employed by Asian Health Services (AHS):
1. Strategic Partnerships and Collaborations: AHS recognized the need to collaborate with other healthcare providers, community organizations, and government agencies to maximize resources, improve patient outcomes, and share the burden of increased demand. These partnerships helped streamline referral processes, provide supplementary services, and enhance multilingual resources.
2. Expansion of Services and Facilities: AHS responded to increased demand by expanding its range of services, such as mental health support, preventive care, and chronic disease management. The organization also invested in expanding its facilities to accommodate the growing patient population and reduce wait times.
3. Enhancing Language Access: Recognizing the importance of addressing language and cultural barriers, AHS invested in interpreter services, translated materials, and culturally sensitive training for staff. These initiatives aimed to improve communication and ultimately enhance patient satisfaction and health outcomes.
Remaining issues and strategies for improvement:
1. Addressing the Needs of Underserved Communities: While AHS has made strides in improving healthcare access for the Asian population, there is a need for further outreach and tailored services to reach underserved communities. AHS should continue collaborating with community organizations and conducting effective outreach campaigns to ensure equitable access to care.
2. Strengthening Health Education and Prevention Efforts: To reduce the burden of chronic diseases and promote preventive care, AHS should prioritize health education programs tailored to the cultural and linguistic needs of their patients. By empowering individuals with knowledge and preventive measures, AHS can improve overall health outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.
3. Leveraging Technology and Innovation: AHS should explore the integration of telehealth, electronic health records, and other digital solutions to enhance access and efficiency in service delivery. Leveraging technology can help address issues like wait times, long commutes, and language barriers, ultimately improving patient experience and meeting the evolving demands of healthcare delivery.
Importance of mission, vision, and values statements in guiding strategic plans:
AHS's mission, vision, and values provide a guiding framework for strategic planning and decision-making within the organization. They shape the organization's identity, purpose, and long-term goals. Aligning the strategic plan to these statements ensures that AHS remains focused on its core principles, cultural competencies, and commitment to the Asian community.
Additionally, mission, vision, and values statements help AHS establish a competitive edge in the external setting. These statements communicate the organization's unique value proposition, foster trust with stakeholders, and attract partners and resources that align with AHS's goals. By staying true to their mission, AHS can navigate changes brought about by external factors while maintaining their identity and fulfilling their purpose.
Conclusion:
The introduction of the ACA presented significant challenges for Asian Health Services, primarily in terms of funding constraints, increased demand, and language and cultural barriers. However, through strategic partnerships, service expansion, and improved language access, AHS adapted to overcome these challenges. To further improve outputs and resolve emerging complications, AHS should focus on addressing the needs of underserved communities, strengthening health education efforts, and leveraging technology. Aligning their strategic plan with their mission, vision, and values will guide AHS in addressing these issues and remain impactful in the external healthcare setting."
"Introduction
This presentation will focus on how three different news sources report on the Olympics 2022 in Beijing. The three articles were published in Sports Illustrated, ESPN, and CNN. The focus of the three pieces is on the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics, which took place in Beijing. The Olympic games are a major event in sports on the global level because it allows athletes from many different states to compete and showcase their skills and potential. Therefore, by reviewing this event and how different news sources write about it, one can compare the different approaches to reporting and varying political and social positions.
The first news source is Sports Illustrated, and the article is titled “How to Watch Winter Olympic Closing Ceremony: Live Stream, TV Channel, Start Time” and written by Carter (2022). In this article, the author writes about the Olympics’ clothing ceremony with a focus on the American athletes who have won medals and will be present at this ceremony. Also, the author provides some details regarding the time of streaming and the news channels where one will be able to watch the ceremony. This article is focused on glorifying the American team and on emphasizing the winners, such as Elana Meyers Taylor.
The second article covering the topic of the Winter Olympics closing ceremony is the one published by ESPN. The author is Hamilton (2022), and the title of this article is “Winter Olympics 2022: Highlights from the closing ceremony in Beijing.” This article mainly focuses on social media’s reaction to the games and their closing ceremony, which is shown in Picture 1. Hamilton (2022) also mentioned the controversy surrounding these games due to the ongoing pandemic that continues to affect people’s lives. Hence, this article is more complex when compared to the first one and covers a broader range of topics, including the social and political factors linked to the Olympic Games 2022.
The final news source that also reported on the closing ceremony of the Olympic Games 2022 is CNN. This article is written by the CNN team and contains little text and a plethora of images that describe the final ceremony. The title of this article is “In pictures: The Olympics closing ceremony in Beijing” (2022), which explains the focus on the photographs as opposed to the text. An example of this is shown in Picture 3 above. Before showcasing the pictures, the authors briefly discuss what the Olympic games are, their purpose, the previous Olympics that were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and other background information.
Statistics
The statistics support several features that are associated with both the Olympics and globalization. The 2022 Olympics occurred in the three regions of Beijing, Yanqing, and Zhangjiakou with 12 competition venues. This introduced viewers and athletes to several locations and cultural heritage spots of which they were likely previously unaware. The events were widely broadcast with as many as 24 official rights-holding broadcasting companies present throughout the Olympics. More than 300 sublicensees were also able to depict and discuss the event which allowed for the variety of reporting and news releases throughout the sources we observed. Over 1952 accredited press staff members were present, with 1491 of which were from non-domestic organizations. 520 news outlets, and 602 photographers operated during the events. As such, the statistics illustrate the extent to which globalization has been ingrained in the reporting of such massive global events as the Olympics. While news outlets have specific needs and views and report regarding their nations, they are still entwined and involved in the overall progression of the event.

"The Rise of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade in Western Africa, 1300–1589 is a book by Toby Green that examines conditions in Iberia and West Africa in the 14 th and 15 th centuries that set the stage for the subsequent complex interactions between Europeans and Africans. Despite the title, the book mostly focuses on 1460 to 1589, when Cape Verde Islands hosted most of the trade. The book will interest Atlantic explorers and the general public curious about European expansion and maritime trade (Shumway 731). However, it may not be the most accurate predictor of the subsequent historical events. Green thoroughly analyzes Cape Verde as becoming a place where European colonizers shipped, traded, and used enslaved Africans for agricultural cultivation. He then portrays the settlers from Iberia, mostly New Christian Jews, arguing that their prior exposure to violence and exclusion in Europe influenced how they based a new society on slavery and the slave trade in the new location. The narrative then compares the African situation with other slave trades, including Islamic slave-owners engaged in the trans-Saharan trade, Mandinka diaspora, and early slave trade from Upper Guinea by Portuguese. Drawing on archival sources in Europe, Latin America, and the Caribbean, most of the narrative focuses almost exclusively on coastal and island locations of the Iberian trade. Additionally, inland Africa and places in Europe and the Americas connected to Cape Verde by sea trade are occasionally mentioned. Green covers the earliest European maritime activity and settlement phase in the Cape Verde Islands and the West African coast between the Senegal River and Sierra Leone. The last part of the narrative states that colonizers then used the slave trade experience in West Africa in the Americas to suppress the Native American population.
The author’s overarching aim in comparing worldwide slave trades is to state that many of the historical numbers have been underestimated. However, this argument does not address a still highly uncertain number of enslaved Africans taken out on slave ships, and thus the quantitative methods to estimate the volume of trade will likely refute this interpretation. Moreover, Greene rejects that African gold was more important than slaves to the first generations of European traders in Africa, a generally supported historical view (Shumway 730). Lastly, Green fails to see the global picture: for instance, the Upper Guinea slave trade before 1589 represents only 1-2 % of the total slave trade. Greene’s desire to ‘redefine’ the entire transatlantic slave trade and emphasize the dominant role of Cape Verde and Upper Guinea discredits the extant historical work of on the early slave trade from West-Central Africa. Furthermore, the exaggerated claim about Atlantic colonization impacted by the African slave trade habits calls for additional analysis. While the narrative certainly contributes to a historical understanding of the Atlantic world formation, it doubtfully advances one’s understanding of later world histories, such as the colonization of Africa and economic globalization (Shumway 730). Moreover, Green claims that historians have failed to appreciate the impact of the extermination of the Native American population on the subsequent forced migration of Africans to the Americas. Such a claim is untrue – there is prevailing acknowledged information on America’s labor shortage and its’ impact of increased colonists’ demand for slaves in public education (Shumway 730). Overall, The Rise of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade in Western Africa, 1300-1589 contributes to the historical understanding of the beginning of the European slave trade in Africa and places the Cape Verde Islands at the center of its history."
"Social behavior is a complex of behavioral patterns typical for most of society at a particular time. There are several types of them, but they all are characterized by a lack of specific structure, even in the case of deliberately organized movements. It is due to many different influences between all social movement’s members. If they are not directed by some external or internal motivational force, such as political will or money, which organizes them, they are easy to dissolve eventually. The spread of the Internet and social media leads to massive changes in social movements’ creation, organization, and dissolving, allowing much quicker information exchange.
Social movements are various, and social media influence them all directly. Uncontrolled movements are initiated by some changes in the world, which are influential for people: for example, financial crises, wars, or even some rumors about important events. Such rumors can even be not true: the prominent example was the case with Sony and Apple in 2010. There were a lot of posts on Facebook and other social media about hypothetical plans of Apple to acquire Sony ( Types of Collective Behavior – Introduction to Sociology: Understanding and Changing the Social World , 2016). They were not true but led to a rise in Sony’s stock price, which depicts how easily social behavior may change under strong stimuli and due to quick spreading.
Thus, one can see that social media made social movements much easier to create and much easier to dissolve. They facilitate information exchange, and therefore, all events may become known to many people rapidly via social media posts, online news, and blogs. The consequence is that the social movement, created in response to a stimulus, such as rumors about a large company, will be formed instantly, and its consequences will reveal very quickly, too."
"In the piece under review, Putnam seeks to investigate the nature of pain, specifically, to identify whether it is a brain state or not. He highlights the dissimilarity of brain structure in various forms of life through the example of an octopus and a mammal, from which the difference in their “physical-chemical” functionality emerges (Putnam, p. 56). Simply stated, the ways activity occurs in the brain may differ from one type of it to another. This, according to Putnam, drives to the conclusion that physical responses most living creatures demonstrate, including pain, are not exclusively brain states.
An essential nuance, at which the thinker points, is that such reactions normally manifest themselves in particular behavior that enables detecting the state. For instance, it is possible to guess that a certain organism is experiencing pain, hunger, uncomfortable temperature, or other from its movements or the sounds it is emitting (Putnam, p. 56). This serves to prove that the states are not limited to changes in brain activity, but can also determine its bodily equivalent; therefore, it is more reasonable to consider them complex. Specifically, the term Putnam offers to classify basic physiological response to irritants, which interfere with the well-being of an organism, is “a functional state” (p. 54). His hypothesis tells that to feel pain, a living creature needs to possess an appropriate type of functional organization, which actually determines this condition, making it physically possible.
In the simplest terms, Putnam rejects the identical nature of mental and physical properties, which two hypothetically are intertwined up to inseparability. Horowitz mentions that such a viewpoint falls under the philosophy of “type-physicalism” (p. 81). Meanwhile, Putnam labels it “the brain state theory” (p. 55). His main argument against it, as mentioned, rests on the fact that mental conditions can have various behavioral manifestations, therefore, they hardly share certain physical nature.
Putnam’s view doubtlessly is closer to reality in comparison with type-physicalism, primarily because of sufficient practical evidence. In fact, different creatures may act dissimilarly when in pain; thus, they may twitch or shrink, cry, moan, or squeeze, or other. Furthermore, several species, including humans but not limited to them, can camouflage their discomfort to avoid becoming excessively vulnerable. These are the examples to illustrate that physiology-based response to irritants, such as pain, is “multiply realizable” (Horowitz, p. 82). This assumption, in turn, separates mental properties from physical since otherwise, all creatures that are able to feel pain would behave identically.
It is worth noting that some philosophers attempted to compromise the validity of Putnam’s argument, proclaiming that, although the nature of pain apparently is different in various species, it is identical in one. This statement, however, is false as well; empirical data show that the functional structure of brain, including human, can transform. For instance, a serious injury of particular brain areas can lead to a situation where the other begin to perform their functions, so that the organism returns to homeostasis (Horowitz, p. 82). This actually is another scenario of how the realization of mental states can be multiple, which is observable even within one species. Therefore, it is more relevant to classify pain as a function with the focus on the behavior that manifests it.
To summarize, the hypothesis to which Putnam refers as the brain state theory and which he opposes strongly is doubtful. Notably, the adepts of this view equalize mental states to physical, proclaiming that the former, including pain, share unique physical nature. However, in such a case, actions of organisms in pain would be identical as well, which, as empirical evidence shows, does not correspond to reality."
"Introduction (approx. 50 words):
Law enforcement officers are often faced with the ethical dilemma of accepting gratuities, such as small gifts or tokens of appreciation. This essay discusses the multifaceted arguments surrounding the acceptance of gratuities by law enforcement officers, weighing the potential benefits against the risks it poses to their integrity and public trust.
Body (approx. 150 words):
On one hand, proponents argue that allowing law enforcement officers to accept gratuities can foster positive relationships with the community. By accepting small gifts or tokens of appreciation from citizens, officers may appear approachable, aiding in building rapport and trust. These acts of gratitude might strengthen the bond between law enforcement and the public, leading to increased cooperation and more efficient crime prevention. Additionally, accepting minor gratuities could be viewed as a legitimate form of compensation for the risks officers face daily, particularly in contexts where resources might be limited.
On the other hand, accepting gratuities can have detrimental effects on the integrity and impartiality of law enforcement officers. It raises concerns about preferential treatment, potentially skewing an officer's judgment and decision-making process. The acceptance of gratuities might also create the perception of corruption, eroding public trust in law enforcement agencies. In a profession that relies heavily on neutrality, even the appearance of impropriety can undermine the legitimacy and effectiveness of police work. Moreover, unchecked acceptance of gratuities opens the door for exploitation and may leave room for more significant forms of bribery or compromise.
Conclusion (approx. 50 words):
To strike a balance, policies should be in place that prohibit law enforcement officers from accepting gratuities. Instead, emphasis should be placed on alternative approaches, such as promoting community engagement programs and providing officers with adequate compensation. Prioritizing trust, impartiality, and maintaining high ethical standards is vital for law enforcement agencies to effectively serve and protect their communities."
"Introduction: 
In the digital age, the prevalence of fake news has become a pressing concern demanding immediate attention. This essay aims to shed light on the significance of identifying and addressing fake news in today’s society. It will delve into the potential consequences of consuming and spreading false information, particularly in the realm of social and political issues. Additionally, practical strategies will be outlined to help individuals discern reliable news sources, emphasizing critical thinking and research as key tools in combating fake news.
Body:
1. The Consequences of Consuming and Spreading Fake News:
Consuming and spreading false information can have profound effects on critical social and political issues. Firstly, it erodes public trust in the media, fostering a climate of skepticism. As individuals become more skeptical, they may be prone to rejecting reliable information, thus hindering social progress. Secondly, false news can manipulate public opinion, leading to the distortion of political discourse and even electoral outcomes. The infamous dissemination of fake news during the 2016 U.S. Presidential election and its impact on public perception exemplify this danger. Additionally, fake news can exacerbate societal divisions, as it often promotes provocative narratives that reinforce pre-existing biases, further polarizing communities.
2. Strategies for Discerning Reliable News Sources:
To combat fake news effectively, individuals must employ practical strategies. Firstly, verifying the source is crucial. Reputable news organizations often adhere to ethical reporting standards and maintain transparency. Secondly, examining the author's credibility is essential. Professional journalists typically possess relevant qualifications and industry experience, enabling them to provide accurate and balanced reporting. Lastly, fact-checking information is pivotal. Prominent fact-checking organizations such as Snopes and PolitiFact serve as valuable resources in verifying the veracity of claims.
3. Critical Thinking and Research as Remedies:
Critical thinking and thorough research are fundamental in battling fake news. By employing critical thinking skills, individuals can identify logical fallacies, recognize bias, and distinguish between fact and opinion. Furthermore, conducting independent research on the topic at hand allows individuals to cross-reference information and identify inconsistencies or inaccuracies in reporting.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, the identification and addressing of fake news are paramount in contemporary society. The consequences of consuming and spreading false information have far-reaching implications for critical social and political issues. Practical strategies, such as verifying sources, examining author credibility, and fact-checking, equip individuals to discern reliable news sources. Ultimately, critical thinking and intensive research serve as indispensable tools in the battle against fake news, enabling individuals to uphold the integrity of societal discourse and make well-informed decisions."
"Deductive reasoning involves the construction and development of cause-and-effect solid relationships. It is noteworthy that the connection is established either between two facts or a point and the idea of how it will affect the future (Besnard & Hunter, 2018). Thus, a judgment (logical expression) includes the first – the prerequisites, the second – the conclusion. In logic, an argument is valid only when it has a form that makes it impossible for the premises to be correct and the judgment to be wrong. According to the explained three types of deductive arguments, a valid statement does not need to have actually trustworthy premises. Still, it must have ones that, if they were accurate, would guarantee that the conclusion is proper.
Example:
 1. All metals are heavy
 2. Tin is a metal
 3. Tin is heavy
A sound argument must have both a valid form and true premises. Valid arguments can be unsound, but they will have wrong assumptions.
Example:
 1. All dogs are cats
 2. All mice are dogs
 3. All mice are cats
What makes this a valid statement is not that it has trustworthy premises and a proper conclusion but the logical necessity of the judgment, given the two assumptions. The argument would be just as valid if the premises and conclusion were wrong. However, it is essential to determine that the purpose of argumentation is to establish the truth of a judgment. An invalid argument does not achieve this goal, so it cannot be considered sound (Besnard & Hunter, 2018). A sound argument has a valid form and true premises; thus, it cannot be invalid in all cases. If the argument is invalid, then the beliefs thoroughly do not matter, and, in fact, only the conclusion remains. Therefore, this means that there is no argument in this case, especially a sound one."
"Introduction:
Blues poetry, rooted in African American musical traditions, has long served as a powerful medium of expression, reflecting the struggles, joys, and experiences of a marginalized community. This essay delves into the thematic elements and stylistic characteristics that define blues poetry, providing examples to support the analysis.
Thematic Elements:
1. Sorrow and Despair:
Blues poetry often explores themes of sorrow, despair, and the bleak realities of life. It gives voice to the hardships endured by African Americans in a discriminatory society. For instance, Robert Johnson's iconic blues song ""Hellhound on My Trail"" showcases this thematic element with lyrics like ""I've got to keep moving, blues falling down like hail."" The poet's profound anguish and desperation are palpable.
2. Longing for Freedom:
A prevalent theme in blues poetry is the yearning for freedom, both personal and collective. Artists like Langston Hughes often use blues form to express this longing. In his poem ""The Weary Blues,"" Hughes writes, ""I heard a Negro play / Down on Lenox Avenue the other night / By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light / He did a lazy sway."" Through vivid imagery and rhythmic language, the poem evokes a deep desire for emancipation from societal constraints.
3. Love and Loss:
Blues poetry also frequently explores themes of love and loss, capturing the bittersweet experiences of relationships. In her poem ""Blues in Bed,"" Sonia Sanchez writes, ""it is here that i touch you / love you / cry over you / share / the oneness / it is here / love / you understand."" Sanchez's deeply personal and intimate portrayal of love resonates with the audience, demonstrating how the blues serves as a vehicle for expressing the complexities of romantic relationships.
Stylistic Characteristics:
1. Repetition:
Repetition is a fundamental stylistic characteristic of blues poetry that emphasizes emotions and ideas. Within the blues tradition, artists often repeat lines or phrases to accentuate the significance of a thought or feeling. In ""St. Louis Blues,"" W.C. Handy employs repetition with the lines, ""I hate to see that evening sun go down / I hate to see that evening sun go down."" The repetition reinforces the heartache being expressed and creates a memorable rhythm for readers and listeners alike.
2. Call and Response:
The call and response technique, borrowed from African musical traditions, is a prominent feature of blues poetry. It involves a verse or line being presented and subsequently answered or echoed by another verse or line. For example, in Muddy Waters' song ""Hoochie Coochie Man,"" he sings, ""I'm a man / Spelled M, A child, N / That represents man / No B, O child, Y / That mean man."" The call and response structure serves to engage the audience and create a participatory experience, characteristic of the blues aesthetic.
3. Symbolic Language:
Symbolism is often employed in blues poetry to convey deeper emotions and experiences. Artists may use metaphors or symbols to capture the essence of their content. For instance, in Maya Angelou's poem ""Caged Bird,"" she writes, ""The caged bird sings with a fearful trill / Of things unknown but longed for still."" Through the symbolism of the caged bird, Angelou articulates the longing for freedom, imprisonment, and the bondage that many African Americans endured.
In conclusion, blues poetry is a rich and poignant art form that encapsulates the African American experience. Through its thematic elements of sorrow, longing for freedom, love and loss, and its stylistic characteristics of repetition, call and response, and symbolic language, blues poetry provides a powerful and profound form of expression. Artists like Robert Johnson, Langston Hughes, Sonia Sanchez, W.C. Handy, Muddy Waters, and Maya Angelou have enriched the genre with their unique contributions, leaving an indelible mark on literary and musical history."
"Accounting plays a vital role in enabling informed decision-making in business. It provides essential financial information that allows stakeholders to evaluate the financial health of an organization and guide their decision-making processes. Additionally, the communication of financial information differs for internal users, external users, and government entities, necessitating various approaches. This essay will discuss the importance of accounting in enabling informed decision-making and the different approaches required to communicate financial information effectively to these different stakeholders.
Accounting serves as a language of business, providing a systematic way to record, analyze, and communicate financial information. It enables stakeholders to evaluate the financial position, performance, and cash flows of an organization, helping them make informed decisions. Through accounting, financial statements such as the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement are prepared. These statements provide an overview of an organization's financial condition, profitability, and liquidity. For instance, internal users like management rely on these financial statements to assess the financial performance of an organization and make strategic decisions, such as expansion plans or cost-cutting measures.
On the other hand, external users, such as investors and creditors, use accounting information to evaluate the creditworthiness and investment potential of an organization. Informed decisions about investing or lending capital can be made based on financial statements, ratios, and other accounting information. For instance, potential investors analyze financial statements to assess the profitability, growth prospects, and risk profile of a company before deciding whether to invest. Likewise, creditors examine financial data to determine if a business can repay its debts and evaluate the terms of lending.
Government entities also rely on accounting information to fulfill their regulatory and public policy objectives. Through financial reporting standards and regulations, governments ensure the transparency, integrity, and accountability of financial statements, providing users with accurate information. Governments use this information to enforce tax laws, monitor compliance with regulations, and make informed decisions regarding economic policies. Additionally, financial information assists policymakers in better understanding the economic landscape and formulating strategies to promote economic growth and stability.
Given the diverse needs of stakeholders, it is important to communicate financial information effectively. Internal users, such as management, require detailed and confidential information to make strategic decisions. Monthly management reports, budgetary control reports, and variance analysis are commonly used to communicate financial information within an organization. These reports may include detailed analysis of revenues, costs, and other financial metrics tailored to the needs of internal users.
In contrast, external users need summarized and standardized financial information that is comparable across different organizations. Financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) or international financial reporting standards (IFRS) provide a common framework for external users to evaluate and compare different entities. Additionally, footnotes and accompanying explanations provide further insights into the financial statements, helping external users interpret and understand the numbers accurately.
Government entities require financial information for regulatory purposes and policymaking. They often establish their own reporting frameworks, such as the Generally Accepted Government Accounting Principles (GAGAP), to ensure compliance with specific accounting and reporting standards. Standardized financial reports, audits, and disclosure requirements help governments monitor fiscal sustainability, corruption, and overall financial integrity.
To sum up, accounting plays a crucial role in enabling informed decision-making in business. Through financial statements and other accounting information, stakeholders can evaluate an organization's financial health, make investment or lending decisions, and enable governments to fulfill regulatory objectives and formulate public policies. The communication of financial information varies for internal users, external users, and government entities, with different approaches required to meet their specific needs. By accounting for these diverse stakeholders, organizations can effectively address the informational needs of different users and foster a transparent and accountable business environment."
"The coronavirus pandemic, which broke out all over the world for almost three years, completely changed the way of life of the modern world. Many researchers, journalists, and writers cover this topic and talk about various situations that can sometimes lead to shock. O’Connor Meg wrote about one of these cases in the article “Maricopa county moved homeless people to Sweltering parking lots in response to COVID-19”. This analysis aims to study this material in order to identify what actions were taken incorrectly and what consequences this entailed.
People without permanent residence have become a particular threat to the spread of the pandemic. This is because this group has nowhere to live, and they often have close contact with each other, do not follow hygiene rules, and have minimal access to medical care. One of the opinions is that it is necessary to limit its causes with this problem. In other words, it is necessary to increase the level of social assistance to the homeless, increasing the availability of housing and social benefits. On the other hand, it is believed that homelessness and unemployment are psychological phenomena, and external factors cannot significantly contribute to their elimination. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic and the situation of the homeless have become particularly acute in the United States of America.
The incident described in the article under study occurred in Maricopa County. There, next to Arizona’s biggest homeless shelter, Central Arizona Shelter Services (CASS) has been hosting tents with homeless people for a long time (O’Conner para. 1). As a measure to combat COVID-19, the state decided to relocate and encamp the camp near the encampment as part of Maricopa County’s, which was now located in the open air. Thus, hundreds of people were forced to change their habitat to a fenced asphalt place without shade in the triple-digit summer heat.
As an example of a victim of homeless resettlement, there was the case of Elisha McKinley. Even though the woman has almost found a place to live, she was moved to the camp a few months ago. Moreover, McKinley faced police misconduct, as they threw away a cart that contained birth certificate, IDs and house-warming gifts from her daughter (O’Conner para. 5). In addition, although the government initially assessed these measures as temporary, permanent lamps were installed, from which people were expelled, preventing many of them from returning to the same place.
All these measures were taken to contain the outbreak among the homeless part of the population, but the government managed to keep the situation under control. In addition to the absurdity of bringing people out into the open under the scorching sun, this decision was met with great doubt both from society and the state authorities. This factor became stronger after it became known about the death of three people in the fenced parking lot.
Moreover, despite the negative in the direction of moving homeless people to the parking lot, social services request to change the zoning permit, that is, to increase it. This decision should attract a more significant number of people without a home. However, like the initial measure to move the camp, this initiative was met with a counter-action. In this case, businesses and homeowners in the neighborhood are dissatisfied with it. Such an attitude can significantly slow down the expansion process, as the services will have to wait for the city council’s approval. Based on the hostile experience of implementing the initiative concerning homeless camps, the Phoenix government is taking new measures. Hence, Phoenix raised money to rent one hundred and fifty hotel rooms for homeless residents, but this is only a tiny fraction of the entire infected homeless population.
Therefore, this work carried out an analysis of the article about the not entirely fictitious actions of the right of Phoenix. The authorities, in the fight against a new coronavirus infection, moved homeless people to a fenced parking lot in the heat. This action led to the death of several people, which led to a wave of discontent from the general public. Because the pandemic is still not defeated, many people are losing their jobs and applying for unemployment benefits. Therefore, service providers and the state government need to work out measures to solve the potential problem. One of the positive trends has become the distribution of housing rental assistance."
"Introduction (50 words):
Nike, a global athletic footwear and apparel brand, has been heavily criticized for its corrupt corporate culture and its adverse impact on women. In response to these concerns, this essay evaluates the potential effectiveness of dissolving Nike as a means of rectifying the issue. Additionally, alternative approaches will be explored, highlighting potential strategies to address the problem constructively.
Body:
1. Evaluating the Dissolution of Nike (100 words):
Dissolving Nike may appear as a drastic solution that could potentially hold the company accountable for its corrupt practices. However, it fails to address the core issue holistically. The potential effectiveness of this solution is limited, as it overlooks finding long-lasting solutions and ignores employees who might be negatively affected by job losses. Furthermore, it fails to consider the broader implications on stakeholders such as athletes, suppliers, and consumers.
2. Alternative Approaches (150 words):
a) Strengthening Corporate Governance: Implementing robust internal controls, ethical guidelines, and transparent reporting mechanisms can foster a culture of integrity within Nike. Holding senior management accountable, emphasizing diversity, and ensuring equal opportunities are crucial steps in promoting positive change.
b) Enhancing Workplace Policies: Enforcing strict anti-discrimination policies and establishing comprehensive training programs can address the impact of Nike's corrupt culture on women. This approach would aim to eliminate gender disparities, foster an inclusive work environment, and empower women at all levels of the organization.
c) Collaborative Partnerships: Nike should engage with external organizations, including women's rights groups and labor unions, to develop joint initiatives that promote fair labor practices, gender equality, and corporate responsibility. Constructive collaborations could help address systemic issues while also rebuilding trust with consumers and stakeholders.
3. Implementing External Oversight (100 words):
Creating an independent external oversight body that monitors and audits Nike's operations could further deter corrupt practices. This entity would provide an impartial assessment of ethical compliance and ensure transparency. External oversight would help establish accountability, rebuild credibility, and safeguard against potential relapses into unethical behavior.
4. Consumer Activism (50 words):
Empowering consumers to make informed choices can drive positive change. Raising awareness about Nike's corrupt practices and supporting alternative brands with ethical values can create market pressure, compelling Nike to adopt responsible practices. Consumer activism can act as a powerful force in transforming corporate culture.
Conclusion (50 words):
While dissolving Nike may seem appealing, it is an incomplete solution that fails to address the underlying issues. Instead, a multifaceted approach that combines strengthening corporate governance, improving workplace policies, establishing external oversight, and engaging in collaborative partnerships holds greater potential for rectifying Nike's corrupt culture and achieving lasting change."
"In the modern world, diverse communities exist that support families in situations of emergency or need. Such support should be granted as sometimes families cannot manage their problems alone. Many communities provide families with support in diverse areas such as foster care, early childhood care, education, and homeless services (Fuss et al., 2021). For example, during the pandemics of COVID-19 many families experienced financial problems due to the ubiquitous job loss. Many such families could not cover their medical costs or even afford to buy normal food. Several organizations help families by caring about their young children or teenagers, providing them with psychological and economic help (Liebenberg et al., 2020). In such situations, to heighten or support the living standard and living conditions, communities can help families by providing them with food, accommodation, financial help, or help them find jobs.
In addition, online communities can be supportive and useful for many families. For example, in situations of grief, people can support each other online or offline; however, grief support will need new approaches due to COVID-19 (Moore et al., 2020). Communities living in one district can help families with fires in their flats by sharing blankets, food, and water or by finding a place to live. Moreover, diverse populations or communities supporting families in their health issues are also valuable.
Although it may seem that such support does not make much difference, it is entirely wrong to look at the situation from such a perspective. Firstly, such communities support individuals or families in cases of emergency or necessity, and in this way, they can provide help to many people. By supporting families, such organizations help not only separate individuals or families, but they maintain an adequate level of life which helps the country on the governmental living by keeping economic showings on an appropriate level."
"Gustave Moreau is a renowned Symbolist who invoked the motifs of ancient myths in his works. An example of such a work is Jupiter and Semele , which he painted in 1985 in France (Smith par. 1). The story expressed on the canvas originated from Ancient Greece, afterward assimilated and revoked by Romans. Namely, Jupiter, the supreme god of the Roman pantheon, fell in love with Semele, a mortal woman, whom he impregnated. His angered wife, Juno, tricked Semele into pleading with Jupiter to reveal his genuine appearance before her. This wish was fulfilled, yet the divine nature of Jupiter’s emanation was above the limits of what a human can perceive and suffer, so Semele died, and her child was cut out of her body. Moreau’s work depicts this tragic plot and indicates the theme of the difference between humans and the divine by portraying Jupiter and Semele on the border of heaven and the underworld.
The mentioned piece of art might seem somewhat baroque because of the excessive sumptuous details. The central figure in the painting is giant Jupiter with luminous thunders haloed over his head. He sits on a throne, enriched with Eastern-style figurines and jewel-like flora, and holds frightened Semele, who bleeds and looks like a marble statuette. Above the god, giant columns penetrate the heaven; in the down part, various divinities and phantasmagoric creatures abide. Nearby Jupiter’s throne, Moreau placed an eagle, two struggling females, and a fawn, which would be identified later in the work. Although there is a clear symmetric composition of the painting, its multiple elements make it difficult to discern the dominant images.
Indeed, the central detail might be said to be Jupiter’s enormous body and visage. He wears countless ornaments and gems, as well as symbolic objects of various cultures: for example, Indian lotus and Egyptian scarab. These artifacts might signify the despotic nature of the heavens’ sovereign, similar to that of the Eastern rulers and Egyptian pharaohs. Moreover, the stern and penetrating gaze, aimed at the viewer of the painting, demonstrates the resolute spirit of the god. Hence, in Jupiter, Moreau portrayed the saturated divine essence, which is all-powerful and looming over humans.
Next, Semele is highlighted by the whitish color of her skin and gown; she is also a dominating detail. Her appearance contrast with that of Jupiter: she is almost nude, with only some cloth laying on her leg. This image symbolized the nakedness of humans before the god, which is most likely Christian God, although Moreau uses symbols unrelated to Christianity. The newborn Dionysus, who is dispatched from Semele already, as seen by the blood of her body, is often compared to Jesus. Thus, Semele’s direct interaction with god demonstrates the inability of humans to conceive the divine because of the immense differences between them.
Furthermore, three figures attract the attention of the viewer: the two sitting women and a half-man near Jupiter. From the left, the first female is Death holding a speared sword with blood on it and either covering her face from shame or removing tears with a piece of her dress (Smith). Next to her, Pan with the hooved legs resides; he is another Greco-Roman divinity and a symbol of terror. Finally, the woman in medieval clothes and with a thorn wreath over her head is Pain or Sorrow (Smith). These characters illustrate the stable accompanying states of human living. Thus, one more time, the mortality, suffering, and angst of people are contrasted with God’s realm.
Finally, it is necessary to outline the meaning of the depiction of the upper world and the lower domain. The divine part, which surrounds Jupiter’s throne, is embedded with picturesque architecture, vegetation, and angelic figures appear in it. In turn, the downside of the painting illustrates, for example, Hecate, who was a divine patron of witches and sorcerers. The other winged or haloed divinities and creatures are also present. This is probably the human world, full of evils and unknown threats. This place and the heavens intersect with each other, indicating a connection between the divine and mortal.
The other theme depicted in the work and connected to the contrast between human and divine might be rebirth. Namely, the death of Semele followed by the birth of Dionysus is the symbol of the uninterrupted cycle of life. Moreover, Dionysus is also considered a god, which means that although the differences between the two worlds are immense, they still have a connection and are interrelated. Hence, whatever cruel and non-benevolent God might be, he is still present in the lives of people.
To conclude, Gustave Moreau’s Jupiter and Semele is a complex composition with a meaning that is not clearly defined. However, this paper demonstrates that the dominant symbols and elements of the painting all play role in contrasting human and divine nature. Thus, Moreau’s presentation of the ancient myth has a completely new sense from the original plot, somewhat affected by Christianity, although depicted with Eastern aesthetics."

"Black Lives Matter is one of the significant social movements affecting the human understanding of race. It is committed to eradicating systemic racism in America. This phenomenon includes, for example, racial prejudice among police officers and judicial injustice against black people. Black Lives Matter involves different branches in more than ten American states. A movement arose after the senseless murder of African American teenager. A year later, a court consisting of five white people and only one black woman acquitted the police officer. The court’s decision caused massive protests from the African American population.
The Black Lives Matter movement is not about individual flaws but the perceived general injustice of the American system, capitalism, and white people’s supremacy. Black Lives Matter and its leaders were definitely part of the American tradition. Their values ​​and beliefs can be traced back to the history of democracy and individual rights founders. The current COVID-19 situation aggravated the Black Lives Matter conflict. In the United States, pandemic-related racial divisions have also exacerbated the general problem. Thirty percent of all infected in the country are people with black skin color (while the black population in the United States is approximately twelve percent).
The Black Lives Matter movement can be described through the relative deprivation theory. According to Ferris and Stein (2020), this theory explains the action of the deprived or oppressed group of people trying to protect their rights. Compared to other groups, black people have been exposed to oppression from the government and society. This social movement is concerned with equalizing the rights of black and white people. Black Lives Matter has contributed to a significant change in the world. Black people try to satisfy their moral and physical needs, which they are deprived of as members of society.
This movement is widely spread worldwide, questioning the current society’s order. People from different countries started to comprehend the scale of the racial problem in America. This movement provoked the discussion about the deprivation of black, empowering people to be tolerant of differences. Thanks to the Black Lives Matter movement, society advanced to a new level of moral development. The necessity of promoting racial and cultural acceptance was highlighted. However, the next step in striving for equality should be governments. The intensity of the protest will not lead America and any other countries towards democracy. It is caused by the fact that each conflicting side is seeking a dictatorship for itself and at least wants to declare their own rights through mass public protests. This global problem requires wiser and large-scale decisions.
Thus, the Black Lives Matter movement has had a significant impact on society. COVID-19 has made visible all the problems, including inequality and injustice, accumulating over the years. In the depths of rejection, people are inclined to endow particular groups with greater advantages. Racism can be considered as part of a self-defense reaction. If white people admit that people with black skin are equal to them, they will find themselves in a tub of unequal in the global world. To solve these inequality issues, superior peoples should be ready to share wealth, mobility, or social capital with the deprived. Some people believe that racial inequality cannot be eliminated entirely because of human nature striving for supremacy over others achieved through comparison. Therefore, the problem of social inequality exists in all countries and must be fought further."
"One of the distinct characteristics of the nursing craft is the professionals’ need to constantly adapt to the dynamic environment of health care service and approaches to patient care. In order to facilitate this process, researchers have identified a series of change theories that seek to systematize the experience of implementing new practices (Udod & Wagner, 2018). The two most widespread theories of change in the nursing practice are Lewin’s change theory and Roger’s five-step theory. In Lewin’s framework, the change process undergoes three major stages: unfreezing, change proper, and refreezing (Udod & Wagner, 2018). Thus, according to this framework, in order to introduce change, the team needs to acknowledge the existing workflow and “unfreeze” this system, actively participate in implementing change and new functional patterns, and, finally, make the change a new generally accepted standard.
Unlike Lewin’s approach, Roger’s model is more oriented towards the staff’s response and acceptance of the change through the gradual shifting process. Indeed, this five-step model implies exhaustive preliminary research, gathering staff’s feedback, conducting a pilot study, and actually implementing the change proposal (Udod & Wagner, 2018). Hence, it may be concluded that while Lewin’s model addresses mostly the implementation of the evidence-proven modifications, the five-step model is designed to prove the suggested change beneficial to the clinical environment.
When speaking of the change proposal for the capstone project, Roger’s approach to change implementation is more appropriate. Considering the fact that the project seeks to justify the hypothesis of the EBP training’s positive impact on nurses’ self-esteem and patient satisfaction, the data collected from the intervention will be crucial for further implementation of this change to nursing practice. This theory has also been proven advantageous by the preceptor, as she has successfully integrated changes into the staff’s scheduling patterns using Roger’s model."
"Osteoarthritis is a disease that affects people all over the world, but is frequently mishandled within the healthcare system. It is one of the most common causes of disability in older persons, resulting in pain, loss of function, and a lower quality of life. On a societal level, the condition is predicted to cost $303 billion in medical bills and lost wages each year (Abramoff & Caldera, 2020). This chronic, severe disease requires continued efforts to limit its incidence, pain, and loss of function.
Osteoarthritis is known for its degenerative effects on articular cartilage, which becomes significantly damaged over time. The smooth cartilage at the ends of long bones and within the intervertebral discs is known as articular cartilage. It provides a low-friction articulation surface while being able to transmit large loads. Even while the collagen in cartilage has a lengthy half-life, it repairs slowly, if at all, even with slight injuries. Although the cartilage transforms the most, the entire joint, including the synovium, joint ligaments, and subchondral bone, is impacted.
Osteoarthritis is often overlooked, despite its significant personal, economic, and societal costs. Even though osteoarthritis frequently coexists with heart disease, diabetes, and mental health issues, and can aggravate the morbidity and mortality associated with these ailments, it is not included in worldwide strategic plans for noncommunicable diseases. Patients and practitioners may be affected by therapeutic nihilism, with misconceptions that osteoarthritis is an unavoidable component of aging and that there are no viable therapies (Abramoff & Caldera, 2020). The affected people are frequently misinformed about treatment options. Current health-care approaches can range from ignoring essential treatments like exercise, weight loss, and education to using expensive, unproven medications for late-stage disease. I find this issue to be the most interesting, although unfortunate, element of both the article and the condition’s perception. I believe that rehabilitation counselling could combine physical and psychological aid to help patients with osteoarthritis and its various consequences."
"Data science is the discipline that studies the life cycle of digital data from appearance to use in other fields of knowledge. It involves researching and analyzing substantial amounts of information and is focused primarily on obtaining practical results. The definition suggested by Os Keyes presumes that this science is the reduction of humanity to something that can be counted. This perspective is engaging in a way that Keyes’s perspective opposes the standard definition of data science. Perhaps, her expression implies that everything in this world could be measured since the discipline is concerned with countable objects and quantitative analysis. There is also an assumption that data science systems want to devour everything possible, including a human’s life, and quantify it. Finally, when it comes to the decision-making process, the systems eliminate the human factor, excluding individuals, thus making it inhumane.
Numerous standardized tests are based on an algorithm that does not allow people to express their opinions. Typically, they are multiple-choice credits where one should choose the right answer. One mistake and one is at a point of no return. It means that systems only accept correct data, not allowing a human to err. As a result, humanity is accustomed to giving the right answers when necessary and at the same time being afraid to say something that will not be automatically approved.
On the other hand, data science is vital in areas where mistakes should be avoided. For example, in healthcare, workers use different electronic systems that assist them in choosing the proper treatment and its dosage. Medication errors occur due to human factors mainly, for instance, when professionals forget to check the expiration date of a drug. Meanwhile, the system will suggest which pharmaceutical is better for the patient and ensure it is not expired."
"Modification of personal computers required the development of more complex hardware and software. For example, buses, which are the communication channels between different internal components and peripheral devices, have become more advanced. Such three types of buses as address, control, and data are known (Farret et al., 2017). The latter is utilized for data exchange between the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and peripherals (Farret et al., 2017). The significance of the address bus is to assist the CPU in locating specific information in the memory, while the control bus regulates data processing. Data buses are represented as a multiple of two and currently include five types: 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 (Farret et al., 2017). These numbers indicate the bits of data that can be delivered simultaneously, and the larger ones allow for a more significant amount of information to be processed at a time.
The number of parallel lines in a processor defines how many electrical signals can be exchanged between peripherals and the CPU. The most common operating systems on modern computers are 32 and 64-bit microprocessors. A 32-bit data bus contains thirty-two parallel lines between different structures. In contrast, a 64-bit data bus consists of sixty-four lines, allowing it to run twice as many data exchange processes (Farret et al., 2017). Hence, the fundamental difference between these two types of data buses is the speed at which they can process information. Similarly, the pace at which older versions run data depends on the number of paralleled copper wires between the CPU and other internal parts. Indeed, all these buses have one common function of interchanging data, but they vary in the rate at which operations are transferred due to their structural differences."
"Delegation is the key to success in any type of organization, yet it can be a serious problem in church management. Many ministry leaders, used to working independently, find it hard to imagine that others can handle tasks more effectively. However, as the church grows, it is impossible to do without the help of additional church staff or volunteers. When leaders perform all tasks alone, their energies are spent on tasks that are not part of their duties (Kouzes & Posner, 2017). This decreases the effectiveness of church leadership, which is not acceptable. This problem is all the more urgent when the church leaders are not experienced and young. They may think they have the energy to manage all areas, but the reality is that multitasking can quickly stress them out. To solve the problem outlined, it will be optimal to use a systematic approach characterized by a full analysis of the situation and making rational decisions based on it.
Key stakeholders are senior pastoral leadership, specific church leadership (elders, deacons), and volunteer leaders appointed to participate in the delegation process. When delegating responsibilities to others, it is necessary to explain to them what is expected of them and, in addition, to define their responsibilities in detail. The optimal solution is to provide a culture of empowerment in which leaders quickly encourage and empower employees and volunteers to participate in various initiatives.
Young leaders often provoke the situation when they perform too many tasks. They are happy to help employees because such demand creates the illusion of their indispensability, value, authority, and trust on the part of the team. Inexperienced leaders do not leave time to tackle higher-level and higher-priority tasks by getting involved in every problem. The leader may take it upon himself to solve the employee’s problems, justifying his actions with his incompetence. However, such motives also lead to the trap of reverse delegation. In such a situation, it is better to assign responsibility for the task to an employee who can solve it under the guidance of a more experienced team member.
The essence of a proper delegation is to plan the task and organize the work process to achieve the goals as quickly and efficiently as possible. The problem of excessive workload can lead to quick burnout of the manager, frustration with the subordinates, or simply a dulling of attention. This leads to a decrease in the motivation of subordinates and a decline in the efficiency of their work. Inexperienced leaders risk falling into the trap of reverse delegation: when they will be forced to do the work for a subordinate himself in the end. At the same time, the volume of tasks, the solution of which is left to the leader, is constantly growing. The diagram below illustrates the key reasons why delegation problems arise (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Fishbone Diagram
Bad leadership is costly to companies that profit from their operations. For example, employee turnover costs $5,500 per employee (Bartram, 2019). It costs a quarter of a million dollars per year in a company of 250 people (Bartman, 2019). Certainly, in the case of a church, these financial numbers have little applicability, but the purpose of its existence is to attract followers. If inexperienced leaders make fatal leadership mistakes, decreased attendance and less employee satisfaction with their time in the church are expected.
The 5 Whys method will be appropriate to solve the problem of delegation. The first question is, why does the delegation problem arise? The answer is that this issue emerges because of ineffective management. The second question is, why is ineffective management common in churches? Mistakes arise from the inexperience of employees and their lack of knowledge of key leadership principles. The third question is, why is it important to delegate in the church? This mechanism is necessary because it allows for more effective management of the organization and frees up the leader for more urgent tasks. The fourth question is, why might churches refuse to implement this method? Fear of changing the power structure within an organization as conservative as the church can cause distrust. The fifth question is, why is it still worth using delegation? This mechanism is proven to improve the quality of church functioning and help young leaders feel more confident.
Delegating authority and various tasks in the Christian church is an essential skill that every leader must possess. This tool increases group productivity and gives others the opportunity to learn and grow to share success. By delegating to others, church leaders are actually allowing them to serve. Knowledgeable leaders achieve better results by calling on people with diverse talents and abilities to help them. The ability to delegate to another creates space for joint discussion, for collegial work. And this is precisely the skill, the effort, because, without humility, it is impossible to participate in a dialogue. Without delegating, it is impossible to let the other participant in the collaborative process share his or her vision and knowledge. Delegation of authority can improve the functioning of the church and make it easier to serve young leaders who do not yet have all the skills needed for successful leadership."
"James Brown, often referred to as the ""Godfather of Soul,"" was an iconic figure in the music industry who revolutionized the way we perceive music and performance. His unique musical style and approach to performance set him apart from other musicians of his time in various ways.
One of the key elements that distinguished James Brown from his contemporaries was his incorporation of funk music into his repertoire. During the 1960s, when soul and R&B dominated the charts, Brown introduced a new sound that was infused with funk rhythms. His songs were characterized by a strong emphasis on the downbeat, syncopated rhythms, and a prominent bassline. This unique fusion of soul and funk genres not only appealed to a wide audience but also paved the way for the development of future genres like disco and hip-hop.
Moreover, Brown's innovative use of instrumentation set him apart from other musicians. He assembled an extraordinary band, known as the JB's, which consisted of talented musicians who were masters of their respective instruments. This ensemble became famous for their tight, rhythmic grooves and intricate musical arrangements. Brown himself was a skilled instrumentalist, often performing on the piano and even incorporating elements of classical music into his compositions. This emphasis on instrumental prowess elevated his music beyond simple pop songs, making his performances a testament to the virtuosity of his band.
In addition to his musical style, James Brown's approach to performance was unparalleled, making him a truly revolutionary figure. During his live shows, he showcased his exceptional showmanship, captivating audiences with his electrifying energy and stage presence. Brown was known for his unique dance moves, including his signature footwork known as the ""James Brown shuffle,"" and his ability to command the stage with an unmatched level of intensity. He engaged with the crowd, encouraging audience participation and creating an interactive experience that went beyond simply listening to music.
Furthermore, Brown's lyrics addressed social and political issues, setting him apart from many of his contemporaries in the industry. He used his platform to shed light on the struggles faced by African Americans and to advocate for equality and justice. Songs like ""Say It Loud – I'm Black and I'm Proud"" became anthems for the Civil Rights Movement, empowering African Americans and fostering a sense of pride in their identity.
In conclusion, James Brown's unique musical style and approach to performance truly set him apart from other musicians of his time. His incorporation of funk music, innovative use of instrumentation, unparalleled showmanship, and socially conscious lyrics marked him as a visionary and an influential figure in the music industry. His impact can still be felt today, as his contributions continue to inspire and influence artists across various genres. James Brown's legacy will forever be remembered as a groundbreaking force that changed the landscape of popular music."
"Many concepts have universal definitions but are still too broad because they may have unique and varied meanings to different people. Some may place great importance on money and define it as the most essential value in their life. Other people do not agree with this definition since, for them, money is only one of the ways to achieve a goal. The family also belongs to such concepts – although there are many different dictionary definitions of this social institution, people can still add their meanings to it. The purpose of this paper is to give a general description of the family, list its main characteristics, and relate them to my family.
To begin with, the family is one of the most important social agents and the smallest social unit. As noticed by Mondal (n.d.), it can be defined as “an intimate domestic group made up of people related to one another by bonds of blood, sexual mating or legal ties” (para. 1). At the same time, McCarthy (n.d.) says that the family is “people who share goals and values, have long-term commitments to one another and commonly reside in the same dwelling” (para. 2). However, some people consider themselves their own family or can extend this concept and include friends and pets in it. What is more, this group is not necessarily defined by blood relation – many married couples or single persons adopt children and form a real family unit.
As mentioned above, there are many characteristics of this social group. For example, family is the most valuable concept in a human’s life that usually plays the primary role in one’s socialization (Mondal, n.d.). Within it, ancestry or descent can be traced, and even large families are typically limited in size. Finally, another characteristic is that sentiments and feelings are the strong basis of this unit. Love, affection, and procreation, as well as responsibilities and duties, form most families.
When relating the mentioned characteristics to my own family, I can say that it fits all of them. I have too many relatives, including uncles, aunts, and cousins, and our huge family always tries to spend time together, have fun, and support each other. My brother and I were raised to be loving and affectionate, make ethically right decisions, and share. Our family is based on the most positive feelings and connections, and it is the main concept in our lives."
"High unemployment rates in Panama have become a pressing issue that continues to have a detrimental impact on the country's economy. This essay will delve into the causes of this problem and explore its far-reaching consequences.
Several factors contribute to the high unemployment rates in Panama. One significant cause is the country's unequal distribution of resources and wealth. The rural-urban divide is glaring, with many rural areas lacking access to basic infrastructure and employment opportunities. Additionally, Panama's education system fails to adequately prepare its citizens for the demands of a competitive job market, resulting in a lack of skilled workers. Furthermore, the country's overreliance on the service sector, particularly tourism, increases vulnerability to economic shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to significant job losses.
The impact of high unemployment rates on Panama's economy is concerning. Firstly, unemployment hampers economic growth, as it limits consumer spending power, reduces tax revenues, and depletes the government's ability to invest in infrastructure and public services. This, in turn, leads to a stagnation in business development and decreased foreign investment.
Moreover, unemployment rates correlate with increased poverty levels. Families and individuals struggle to meet their basic needs and are at higher risk of social exclusion. This exacerbates social inequality and strains social safety nets, as the government has to allocate more resources to support those in need. Consequently, high unemployment can lead to increased social tensions, crime rates, and a loss of trust in governmental institutions.
Addressing the issue of unemployment in Panama requires a multi-faceted approach. First and foremost, there must be investment in rural development to reduce regional disparities and create employment opportunities in the countryside. The education system should prioritize equipping students with relevant skills and fostering entrepreneurship to encourage innovation and job creation. Additionally, diversifying the economy by focusing on sectors beyond tourism, such as manufacturing or technology, would provide a more stable employment base and reduce vulnerability to external shocks.
In conclusion, high unemployment rates in Panama have severe repercussions for the country's economy. This issue calls for comprehensive measures, including investment in rural development, education reform, and economic diversification. By addressing these causes and implementing strategies to create jobs, Panama can pave the way for a more resilient and prosperous future."
"The study of what rhetorical tools public personalities use in their speech can be a beneficial aspect to study. With its help, people can get an understanding of how, when, and where people can use rhetorical components. This work aims to study Michelle Obama’s opening remarks at the White House Convention on Food Marketing to Children. The main message of the First Lady was to draw attention to the suppression of the advertising of unhealthy food to minors. In addition, the main appeals that Obama uses are logic and emotional.
The first aspect of rhetoric used in this speech is logic. It implies the justification and reasons for a particular action or event. Michele Obama stated that “between 2008 and 2011, obesity rates among low-income preschoolers dropped in 19 states and territories across the country” (Read Michelle Obama’s Speech on Food Marketing para. 10). Therefore, Obama provides a justification of how important it is for television changes to encourage a proper lifestyle among the younger generation.
The next valuable component of rhetoric in the studied speech of the first lady is the emotional aspect. Thus, Obama emphasizes that “while we have made important progress, when one in three kids is still on track to develop diabetes, and when the diet has now surpassed smoking” (Read Michelle Obama’s Speech on Food Marketing para. 11). In this case, Michele Obama points to the positive results already achieved while also highlighting that children are still at risk.
In conclusion, this work was engaged in analyzing Michelle Obama’s speech on the topic of the harm of the media for introducing the younger generation to healthy habits. To better convey the main idea, the first lady used such components of rhetoric as logic and emotion. They helped to better form and give important information, gave the speech solidity, and improved the audience’s ability to persuade."

"Introduction:
Ian McEwan's Atonement intricately weaves a compelling narrative that examines the profound impact of writing and storytelling on the characters' ability to cope with guilt, loss, and trauma. By employing irony and utilizing an omniscient narrator mode, McEwan masterfully conveys the underlying theme of seeking atonement through writing. This essay explores the significance of writing and narrative in relation to the characters' experiences, delving into the role of the narrator in their pursuit of redemption.
Body:
1. The Therapeutic Nature of Writing:
In Atonement, writing serves as a vital therapeutic tool for the characters struggling with guilt, loss, and trauma. Briony, the central character, attempts to atone for her false accusation by reimagining the past through her writing. By penning her version of events and offering a fictional ending, Briony finds solace in the act of storytelling and attempts to reconcile her guilt. McEwan emphasizes how writing can function as a cathartic process, assuaging the burden of unbearable guilt.
2. The Immersive Power of Storytelling:
Through the character of Robbie Turner, Atonement illustrates the role of storytelling as a means of coping with loss and trauma. As a soldier in World War II, Robbie finds escape in writing letters to Cecilia, transforming mundane details into narratives of hope. The act of writing allows him to temporarily transcend the harsh reality of war, providing him with a sense of purpose and connection. This exemplifies the power of storytelling to offer comfort and healing in times of distress.
3. The Irony as a Reflective Device:
Irony plays an essential role in conveying the theme of atonement through writing. McEwan employs situational irony by juxtaposing Briony's false accusation against her subsequent attempts at redemptive storytelling. This irony exposes the destructive consequences of Briony's initial act and highlights the potential of writing to mend the ruptures caused by guilt and trauma. Furthermore, the irony underscores the complexity of seeking atonement, reminding readers of the inherent limitations of language and narrative when it comes to truly righting past wrongs.
4. The Omniscient Narrator's Impact:
The omniscient narrator mode in Atonement acts as a critical lens through which guilt, loss, and trauma are perceived. By providing insight into characters' thoughts and motivations, the narrator highlights their emotional struggles, allowing readers to empathize with their experiences. This technique bridges the gap between the characters and the readers, ultimately enhancing the emotional impact of their quests for atonement. Furthermore, the omniscient narrator encourages readers to reflect on their own capacity for judgment and forgiveness.
Conclusion:
In Ian McEwan's Atonement, writing and narrative play a pivotal role in navigating the complex terrain of guilt, loss, and trauma. Through the use of irony and an omniscient narrator, McEwan skillfully portrays the redemptive power of writing, revealing its capacity to offer solace, healing, and the possibility of atonement. As we witness the characters grappling with their past mistakes and striving for redemption through their storytelling, we are reminded of the profound significance of writing in helping us cope with our own humanity."
"Culture is the entirety of social norms, behaviors, and customs which distinguish a certain society from the rest of the world. Naturally, some cultures have common features, thus forming cultural clusters. At the same time, leadership is a personality trait that transcends national boundaries. This does not imply that all people with power behave in the same manner, as leaders are also influenced by cultural norms.
Behavior differences are evident in the way people in different clusters view time. Middle Eastern cultures are frequently juxtaposed to Western ones, particularly American. Beehner writes that while “most Middle Eastern nations are past oriented” and uphold traditions, “many Americans believe they can control the future and embrace change for the sole purpose of changing” (72). Barak Obama is an example of a leader who gained prominence by articulating the importance of change.
The list of differences in leadership behaviors is not limited to the perception of the future. Crede et al. have conducted a study in which they ascertain cultural differences in relation to transformational leadership. (23). The most peculiar finding is that “transformational leadership exhibits stronger relationships with subordinate performance in cultures with low levels of gender egalitarianism values” (Crede et al. 23). This implies that the more traditional a culture is, the more successful leaders are likely to be in transformational endeavors.
Altogether, there is a definite influence of culture on the conduct of leaders. Therefore, the definition of culture should include the importance of its effect on leadership behaviors. Not only does culture distinguish a certain social group, but it also underscores the likelihood of changes driven by people who have authority. After all, these people are the ones who make the most important decisions in society."
"Introduction (approx. 70 words):
The adversarial criminal justice system, with its procedural safeguards, has long been a subject of ethical scrutiny. This essay aims to analyze the ethical problems posed by this system, particularly its perceived bias in favor of the accused. By addressing the potential impacts on racial disparities within the American judicial system, we will further examine the findings of the United States Sentencing Commission (USSC) report, shedding light on the profound implications of this issue.
Body:
1. The Ethical Conundrum (approx. 100 words):
The adversarial nature of the criminal justice system presents an inherent ethical dilemma. While promoting fairness, it can inadvertently give the advantage to the accused. The principle of ""innocent until proven guilty"" grants the accused numerous procedural safeguards, such as the right to legal representation, presumption of innocence, and right to a fair trial. However, these safeguards often perpetuate a perception of bias favoring the accused, posing ethical challenges within the system.
2. Perception of Bias and Racial Disparities (approx. 120 words):
Racial disparities in the American judicial system are a deeply concerning consequence of the adversarial criminal justice system. The USSC report highlights that racial minorities, particularly African Americans, face disparate treatment at various stages of the criminal justice process, from arrest to sentencing. The perception of procedural safeguards favoring the accused only exacerbates these disparities. Studies have found that racial biases, both explicit and implicit, lead to disproportionately harsher treatment for minorities, thereby compromising the ethical principles of fairness, impartiality, and equality within the system.
3. The Inequitable Impact on Marginalized Communities (approx. 120 words):
The impact of racial disparities on marginalized communities cannot be understated. Over-policing, biased arrest rates, and harsher sentencing contribute to a vicious cycle of systemic injustices. This engenders a loss of trust in the criminal justice system, diminishing its legitimacy. The ethical implications are further compounded when considering the social, economic, and psychological consequences on affected individuals, families, and communities.
4. Reform and the Pursuit of Justice (approx. 90 words):
Addressing the ethical problems posed by the adversarial criminal justice system requires a multi-faceted approach. Critical reform measures include implementing implicit bias training for law enforcement, fostering diversity within the justice system, revisiting sentencing guidelines, and promoting community-based alternatives to incarceration. By actively engaging in these reforms, society can strive to reduce racial disparities, restore trust, and ethically uphold the principles of justice.
Conclusion (approx. 60 words):
The adversarial criminal justice system, while fundamental to the American legal landscape, poses significant ethical challenges. The existence of bias favoring the accused and its impact on racial disparities require immediate attention and concerted efforts to address. By acknowledging the findings of the USSC report and pursuing comprehensive reforms, we can work towards a more equitable and ethically sound criminal justice system that prioritizes fairness, justice, and equality for all its participants."

"Executive Summary
Bottega Veneta is a worldwide famous brand, but its performance might need a boost owing to the company’s recent growth needs. Bottega’s options include product diversification and the production of a new line of items. The company’s brand must be reinvented by emphasizing the significance of quality in daily things and minimizing the level of luxury associated with its products. Bottega will be capable to establish a novel production line by developing the brand impression in a way that relates it to the firm’s principal identity.
Introduction
Transitioning from a premium company to one that sells things for daily usage is practically impossible. Bottega Veneta, on the other hand, will identify whether all aspects of the corporate communications process are in harmony (Weingerl and Javoršek, 2018). Assuring customers that their daily routines are comfortable while adding a touch of luxury, Bottega will be able to develop an entirely new and extraordinarily profitable brand.
Audit of the Brand
Pen Portrait and Analysis of Competitors
Bottega Veneta brands are primarily focused on attracting feminine as well as macho women, as seen by the photographs. The women here are smart and stylish, live in the contemporary world, are self-assured, and sophisticated. Given that Bottega’s women’s fashion trends are mostly irrelevant, the photographs depict ladies who have their own perspective and discern what is best and more importantly, what garments fit them best. Indeed, these women appreciate comfort above everything else and are willing to spend their money on high-end Bottega brand items. Bottega’s consumers prioritize comfort above innovation, but not rejecting the latter. Additionally, the target population is likely to live in the fast lane because of their proclivity for digital technologies.
Digital Pen Portrait
Figure 1: Digital Pen Portrait.
Analysis of Digital Competitors (POPs and PODs)
PODs will include user comfort, since Gucci, Burberry, and Loewe all market luxury in a similar manner as Bottega, but do not focus on daily things and their use (Achim, 2019). In other words, the items are distinguished by superior materials and timeless designs, which sets them apart from the competitors. Bottega’s majority of items are premium priced because to their exquisite brands and high-quality textiles (Zhang and Zhao, 2019). High quality and efficacy are the primary POPs, which Bottega will need to thoroughly examine to guarantee that the standards established satisfy those used by other firms in the industry.
Brand Inventory
Heritage and History of the Brand
Since 1966, Bottega Veneta has been recognized as a luxury goods and designer clothing company. The firm, based in Italy, has amassed considerable influence in the premium design sector. By concentrating on establishing the brand that will serve as the foundation for a fresh and distinctive brand identity, one may successfully capture the luxury daily items market.
Brand DNA
The brand DNA will enable the business to portray itself as innovative while concentrating on quality and consumer comfort. As a result, the DNA will be designed with the goal of fostering a pleasant existence. The brand’s objective will be to ease everyday routines while also adding excitement and satisfaction. Integrity, customer attention, accountability, and excellent quality will serve as the cornerstone for the brand DNA’s growth (see Fig. 2). The proposed technique, based on the Onion Model, will aid in tracing the transition from the existing brand to the one set to emerge.
Brand Personality
To explain the personality of the brand that will be developed, the Aaker Model will be required. By using Aaker’s five personality characteristics, one may determine that the brand to be established is truthful, highly competent, and fairly sophisticated (Kakitek, 2018). Additionally, the presence of luxurious components may provide a touch of excitement. The harshness of the items will be kept to a minimum in order to preserve their sophistication (see Fig. 3).
Figure 3: Aaker Model for Brand Personalityю
Brand Identification
The brand’s identity will be developed utilizing Kapferer’s method. As seen in Figure 4, it is critical to establish an intercultural relationship between the sender and receiver (Cuofano, n.d.). In the instance of Bottega, a feedback system will be used to build a relationship between the consumer and the firm. The data collected via surveys and questionnaires will be used to include culturally relevant components into brand goods and to adjust them to the unique demands of individual customers.
Figure 4: Kapferer’s method analysis (Cuofano, n.d.)ю
Equity in a brand
To boost Bottega’s brand equity, especially with its new range of items, one must examine Keller’s Brand Equity Model (see Fig. 5). According to the approach, brand identity should be built around how consumers and the business interact; beginning with the organization’s basic values and the viewpoint, it brings to company-customer communication. Thus, Bottega’s new range of goods’ brand equity should be organized on the use of high quality, inventive design to infuse moments of luxury into their customers’ daily lives.
Figure 5: Keller’s brand equity model (Keller’s brand equity model: building a powerful brand, 2021).
Architecture of the Brand
Bottega’s contemporary architecture may be regarded as a branded home, in whom all goods are housed under the Bottega primary brand. However, when a new brand is created that incorporates daily; the need to rethink the present branding strategy may arise. In order to reach their target audience, the firm will need to develop a house of brands.
Brand Leveraging
Bottega will heavily on the strength of its present brand in the early phases of advertising its new items. As a result, the new brand must contain features of the existing one, including the title and potentially the typeface. However, the company’s corporate philosophy, which values individualism and confidence, may be included into the design of the innovative product. Because of their high quality and end outcome, Bottega will strive to promote their emerging brand as dependable.
Brand Positioning
While the current Bottega brand in the desired corporate environment is largely rooted in luxury, the successor one must be grounded on practicality and presented as useful in everyday life. Luxury elements, such as unique architecture and materials used in the new products, will be offered as bonus items, helping to raise brand recognition (Brunetti, Confente, and Kaufmann, 2019). Like Bottega Veneta, the new brand should focus on artisanship and everyday convenience, if not luxury.
Strategy for Branding
AIDA. To generate public attention in the brand, the AIDA model will be required (Prathapan, et al., 2018). Bottega will seek to enlighten the community about its new venture, generate curiosity in the new everyday product brand, and encourage target shoppers to acquire them. Advertising and a webpage will be created, where advertisements will emphasize luxury and comfort to entice buyers with the help of a customer loyalty program to encourage the exercise.
RACE . Additionally, the RACE (Reach, Act, Convert, Engage) Model must be used to advertise the items and pique the audience’s interest. To be more precise, a new communication channel comprised of ICT and contemporary media will be developed in order to reach out to consumers. To promote action (“Act”), the website will have interactive components that allow buyers to tailor their experience. The conversion process will begin after Bottega has amassed a following of committed fans via discounts, gift certificates, and similar methods. Finally, the engagement step will include listening to customer input and tailoring items to their specific requirements.
Licensing/IP
Bottega will retain ownership of the intellectual property and goods, since the new brand will be released under its name. Thus, Bottega will be given intellectual property rights not for the items themselves, but for the idea underlying them, namely the incorporation of comfort and a touch of elegance into everyday routines. Due to the incorporation of the company’s present logo into the mark to be produced for the aforementioned items; it will be important to acknowledge Bottega’s property rights as the owner of the aforementioned intellectual property.
Elements of a Brand
Bottega’s current brand identity is composed of various themes, incorporating opulence and beautiful austerity. To sum up what luxury is and how it can be expressed via accessories and garments, Bottega Veneta’s slogan is “When your initials are sufficient.” (‘Bottega Veneta’ 2019). The logo, printing, symbols, packaging, and colors are all presented as brand aspects.
Logotype for Brand Identity
The present brand identification logo is fairly simple and, as a result, one-of-a-kind. As a consequence, the enterprise’s redesigned trade logo must be beautiful and stylized. The logo must keep the shape of the company’s letters printed in a sans serif typeface for this reason. The defined method will emphasize the company’s integrity while maintaining a strong commitment to its principles and philosophy.
Color of the Logo
Customers will immediately distinguish Bottega’s items due to the usage of color-coding. It will be prudent to utilize colors that enable instant differentiation of items; hence, a brand’s category will be distinguished by divergent colors like red, blue, yellow, green, or any other shade that helps the product stand out.
Icons and Photographs
To be immediately distinct from the logo, the brand icons will need to be far less detailed than the logo. However, simplifying the current brand is more challenging given that it is reflected by the company’s name. Although the purposeful choice of sans serif fonts simplifies the effort, there are still significant barriers to overcome. To do this, the logo must be reduced to the first two letters (BV) in a classic sans serif typeface and the allotted color.
Packaging
Packaging shall be biodegradable, recyclable, reusable, non-toxic, and skin – friendly. Bottega must position itself as an eco-friendly company, which includes sensitive packaging. Each produced item will be delivered in three, six, or twelve-packs to conserve resources.
Branding Strategies
The New Brand Strategy’s Five Objectives
To Increase Brand Awareness
This increases market share and establishes Bottega as an industry leader.
To enlarge our social communities
This goal may be accomplished by using a variety of social media platforms and tactics to provide content that expands our social network communities and viewers.
To bolster customer engagement techniques in order to boost customer loyalty
The aim here will be to recruit reputable or prominent members of the target audience to serve as brand ambassadors.
To Keep a Close Eye on Customer Feedback
It is critical for recording customer sentiments on relevant items that serve as a barometer of satisfaction and progress.
To convert social media followers into qualified leads and new business
Brand content generates social media followers and dialogues that result in new clients. The amount of leads generated through social media platforms is a key performance indicator in this case.
Recommendations
To acclimatize Bottega to the internet age, social media should be utilized to market new products to clients. Additionally, an application must be built to assist prospective purchasers in navigating the corporation’s manufacturing process more effectively (Dwivedi et al., 2021). The investigation revealed that Bottega’s internet ads and visibility are still lacking, despite the fact that the digital revolution has taken over. To remain current and preserve its leadership position, the business should use other social media channels in conjunction with its website possibilities.
Customer Engagement in the Digital Age
Bottega’s digital consumer profile is highly sophisticated. Now, it includes a regard for workmanship, brand loyalty, and customization choices. The emphasis on personalization is anticipated to rise in the digital environment (Shukla and Nigam, 2018). As a result, the potential to enjoy items designed exclusively for them must be leveraged to entice consumers. The corporation will need to explore many variations of each item, such as tote bags and umbrellas with distinctive designs.

"Chapter 3. India. Women of Mughal Empire
In this chapter of the book Women in World History , the Mughal rule and its consequences for women in conquered lands are discussed. The first concept presented in this book is the aspect of slavery. Non-Muslims were allowed to be enslaved according to Islamic laws, so for women, slavery was a greater threat than being forced to conform to a foreign religion and ways of living. Due to famines, many women were sold into slavery or seized to be sold at auctions away from their homes.
At that time, bhakti, an art movement of female poet-saint, began. Bhakti means “devotion”, so this genre concerns religious matters such as denial of pedantry, rejection of asceticism, and depths of personal devotion. This way of self-expression had no boundaries, and its followers (many of whom were women) could present it anywhere. However, this does not mean that women did not struggle with acceptance in those realms. Another critical aspect of women’s lives was the production of cloth. The cloth had become a big part of Indian export, and every woman in a castle was capable of spinning thread (Hughes, & Hughes, 1997). Weaving had become a family production, and many of them settled near cities where silk, cotton, and wool were in great demand.
For royal women of Mughal, a great responsibility was to ensure the health and success of younger generations that were to take power. They educated and advised princes in their coming-of-age and wars for the throne and subsequently influenced politics. Empress Nur Jahan could exceed the power limitations set for women at the time by commending channels of power to herself. She enjoyed displaying her superiority, but she could keep in the background and manipulate others.
Chapter 4. Europe. Witches, Workers, and Queens
Religious cataclysms have colored women’s lives in Europe in the 16th and 18th centuries. On the one hand, due to Protestant ideas of a personal approach to salvation, women were able to access education. On the other, beliefs that women were affiliated with the devil have plagued the minds of authorities. Witchcrazes have been caused by patriarchy and misogyny, and their effects crippled females’ trust and confidence for ages to come. Public executions for witchcraft were ways for men to dominate women through pain, humiliation, and fear.
A significant shift happened in the area of female work and empowerment; when earlier women could perform specialized work and play a prominent role in politics, in the 17th-century men have pushed them off that path. For women, household chores, children bearing, and taking care of them were the utmost priority. Urban crafts that females were involved in mainly consisted of beer-brewing and provisioning (Hughes, & Hughes, 1997). However, at the end of the 17 th century, beer-brewing privileges were lost for women.
While male rulers and philosophers claimed that women were too emotional to be good at governing, plenty of queens came into power in the 16 th century. For many of them, the power was inherited, and some of them governed as regents for male heirs (Hughes, & Hughes, 1997). As opposed to the ideas of men, those women were as competent in managing kingdoms as men could be. An excellent example of that is the Maria Theresa of Austria. She exuded courage, ambition, and common sense when ruling. In addition, she valued education for herself and the authorities. Her life story and actions serve as a rebuttal to misogynistic ideas within authority structures."

"The role of slavery in the development of the Chesapeake and Middle colonies was crucial, as it directly influenced the economic growth, social structure, and cultural dynamics of these regions. The need for a labor force heavily influenced the acceptance and expansion of slavery in these colonies, ultimately shaping their development.
In the Chesapeake region, specifically Maryland and Virginia, tobacco emerged as the dominant cash crop. The labor-intensive nature of tobacco cultivation created a high demand for a large workforce, leading to the adoption of slavery. Initially, indentured servants were utilized, but as the colonies expanded and the number of servants decreased, colonists turned to African slaves who were perceived as more cost-effective and easier to control. Slavery became deeply entrenched in the Chesapeake colonies, with the plantation system and slave labor forming the foundation of the region’s economic prosperity.
Similarly, in the Middle colonies, such as New York and Pennsylvania, slavery played a significant role in their development. Although the Middle colonies were more diverse and had a greater presence of other industries, such as fur trading and agriculture, the need for labor remained vital. Slavery provided a consistent and large workforce, particularly in industries such as agriculture and mining, which depended on manual labor. Additionally, the Middle colonies, being geographically closer to the Caribbean, became major hubs of the transatlantic slave trade, further facilitating the expansion of slavery.
The acceptance and expansion of slavery in these regions were fueled by economic incentives and political interests. As the Chesapeake and Middle colonies experienced rapid economic growth, the plantation owners and colonial elites sought to maintain and maximize their profits. They justified and perpetuated slavery by relying on racist ideologies and arguments that Africans were inferior and better suited to hard labor. Slavery also provided a sense of social hierarchy, allowing wealthy landowners to exert control and maintain their social status.
In conclusion, slavery played a vital role in the development of the Chesapeake and Middle colonies. The economic need for a large labor force influenced the acceptance and expansion of this institution, leading to the establishment of agriculture-based economies and ultimately shaping the social and cultural dynamics of these regions. The legacy of slavery continues to impact these areas, highlighting the ongoing importance of understanding and addressing its historical implications."
"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Frankenstein are distinguishing works related to science and indeed, they have several things in common in terms of how the authors used science (Shelley; Stevenson). Creating pure evil from a monster made by a decomposing body, apparently, two scientists did not know how science would turn into a “horrifying” experience. This essay examines the works of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Frankenstein in providing messages about science and integrity, claiming that science is used as a tool for violence.
To begin with, the majority of the scientists that launched research did not see the studies completed as the comparison between the two scientists suggested. Dr. Jekyll, for example, finds Frankenstein’s numerous scientific experiments and observations fascinating despite his abandonment. Notably, both scientists’ initial reactions to creation are quite clear and obviously different. Another message that Frankenstein’s abandoning of a scientific experiment sends is that the domains of science and integrity have distinct demarcations and bounds. For example, Frankenstein says, “My dreams were therefore undisturbed by reality; and I entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher’s stone and the elixir of life.” (Shelley, 65). A “supernatural creature can only comprehend certain intrinsic concerns,” and competing with such powers will be terrifying in and of itself. After giving life to the “monster” Frankenstein made, a horrible creature, the phrase is valid.
There are selfish motivations regarding the scientific experience in both works. By the manner he exhibits his adoration and wonder of his new scientific discovery, Henry Jekyll, unlike Frankenstein, is motivated by a sense of power and overpowering depravity. He isn’t completely honest about his desire to make a human being to disprove other biblical claims. The way the two scientists approach their research reveals a lot about their personalities.
While both Jekyll and Hyde are enthused about their scientific research, Frankenstein decides to abandon his project, calling it a bad idea. In Jekyll and Hyde, it says, ““Utterson, I swear to God,” cried the doctor, “I swear to God I will never set eyes on him again. I bind my honor to you that I am done with him in this world. It is all at an end.”, showing the acknowledgment of his actions (Stevenson, 123). The other two scientists (Jekyll and Hyde) are shown as self-centered and egotistical, but Frankenstein is regarded as a man of integrity who is true to his ideals and objectives. Frankenstein is also more sorry for starting the experiment.
What is clear is the doctors’ lack of accountability for their carelessness resulted in innocent people’s deaths. Both Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll exhibit this lack of integrity by not telling the truth about the scope of their experiments and by obliterating the majority of the evidence of their respective scientific achievements. Some of the scientific experiments carried out by both Dr. Jekyll and Frankenstein are characterized by illogic and sheer evil. In the end, both scientists had to acknowledge that, despite their scientific knowledge and self-importance, they could not overcome some of life’s strange and incomprehensible conditions, such as creation.
The experiments help understand the scientific ideas and arguments prevalent in the nineteenth century. Frankenstein is forced to abandon his scientific studies on creation after realizing that he is breaking some laws of the cosmos and experimenting with the unknown. This lack of integrity is exemplified by the fact that both scientists overlook human nature in favor of conducting destructive and forceful experiments that rule their consciences. The thought of creating a superior creature engulfs their brains, and they act without thinking about the consequences of their actions.
Every scientific investigation is, in essence, governed by extensive rules of ethics that are predicated on specific levels of integrity which was not followed in both works. All research scientists must follow these ethical guidelines as a condition of employment. Most of the ethical rules and integrity that govern scientific study are broken by Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll. Any breach of such integrity will have an impact on the results of the tests and the very spirit of research. When the two scientists fake evidence in order to get the desired result, their integrity is shattered. Instead of focusing on real and viable scientific discoveries, both Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll solely attempt to gratify personal desires and ego. The two scientists went beyond the ethical limitations of human scientific investigations in their missions to regulate human behavior and discover the secret of creation and life.
The effects are terrible, as evidenced by the two academics’ “questionable study,” revealing the horrifying nature of the science used. The two scientists, Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll, seriously jeopardized the integrity of the scientific study. Human experimentation is a violation of integrity and scientific norms, notwithstanding the fact that Dr. Jekyll utilized himself as a subject in the experiment. The utilization of human cadavers by Frankenstein is also regarded as a complete breach of scientific integrity. Most of Frankenstein’s and Dr. Jekyll’s scientific experiments were conducted in secret, with willful disregard for the potential damage to society. This scientific research, in and of itself, should serve as an illustration of what happens when science’s integrity is questioned.
To conclude, the topics of science and integrity in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Frankenstein are shown from a side of “horrifying” as both led to a terrible experience. There was a violation of ethics in science and it demonstrates what will happen if science is practiced by people who do not follow the code of conduct and ethics. As such, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Frankenstein illustrate how science can be a great tool for violence."

"In recent years, epidemiology has emerged as an essential field in detecting, preventing, and managing diseases on a global scale. The author's view that while complete elimination of diseases may not be possible, advancements in epidemiology and technology can significantly reduce mortality rates is both compelling and well-supported. By considering evidence from various resources, it becomes evident that epidemiology is indeed poised to meet emerging challenges and greatly impact public health.
One significant aspect of the argument is the role of technology in advancing the field of epidemiology. The article ""Transforming Epidemiology for 21st Century Medicine and Public Health"" highlights how technological innovations like big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and precision medicine have already revolutionized the way diseases are tackled. For instance, the advent of electronic health records allows for real-time collection and analysis of vast amounts of patient data. By leveraging these technological advancements, epidemiologists can identify patterns, develop predictive models, and make informed decisions to mitigate the impact of diseases. This convergence of technology and epidemiology has the potential to greatly reduce mortality rates by enabling timely interventions and personalized treatments.
Furthermore, the article ""Epidemiology and Public Health at a Crossroads: The Need for a Broader Concept of Influencing Factors"" emphasizes the importance of a holistic approach to epidemiology. It argues that while infectious diseases have historically been the primary focus, non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases now pose a significant challenge to public health. With the advent of precision medicine and genomics, epidemiologists can delve deeper into the genetic and environmental factors influencing these diseases. By targeting specific risk factors and adopting preventative measures, epidemiology can significantly reduce mortality rates associated with non-communicable diseases.
While complete elimination of diseases may remain elusive, the article ""The Future of Epidemiology: What Role Can It Play?"" reminds us that even small changes in mortality rates can have a substantial impact on public health. By focusing on prevention, early detection, and effective intervention strategies, epidemiologists can significantly reduce the burden of diseases. This notion is supported by real-world success stories like the eradication of smallpox and the substantial reduction in deaths due to infectious diseases through vaccines.
In conclusion, the author's view that advancements in epidemiology and technology can significantly reduce mortality rates aligns well with the evidence presented. The role of technology, the need for a broader approach, and the potential impact of epidemiology on both infectious and non-communicable diseases all contribute to the efficacy of this argument. While achieving complete elimination of diseases may remain an idealized goal, epidemiology will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in combating emerging challenges and improving public health outcomes."
"Diana Kendall claims the current perception of the class has been a construct of the media and based on the construction, the meaning of class is determined. Kendall argues that the media has legitimized inequality in the United States through the assumption, with television programs and newspaper articles creating and reifying class-based stereotypes. Furthermore, Kendall argues that class discussions in the media are rarely explicit; however, their portrayals generate perspectives that impact human behavior. The upper class in society is portrayed positively, while the lower class is framed negatively.
On the one hand, the upper class contains individuals that should be emulated, comprised of caring and generous people, and those with criminal records have remarkably good lives (Kendall 10). On the other hand, the lower class is framed as homeless, poor, largely ignored by the media, and often discussed as abstract statistics. As such, when casting a human face, the demographics of the poor determine how they are framed.
The quality of life may deteriorate from the understanding that as the media focuses on the upper class’s viewpoints and gives voice to their concerns, it neglects the concerns of lower-class members. The conveyed class discourses by the media, including constructions of the homeless and the poor, portrays a lifestyle inflicted by laziness, diseases, crime, and substance abuse (Kendall 94). The dehumanized statistics associated with personalized suffering portray people detached from the broader contributing factors like unemployment, ignorance, laziness, or otherwise responsible people for their misfortunes (Kendall 94). Therefore, courtesy of the detachment, the life quality of the low-class individuals continues to deteriorate since the uneducated and the poor’s needs are overlooked. With attention given to upper-class individuals, the needs of the poor are not voiced; therefore, their lives continue to be exposed to deterioration risks."
"Cost of Advanced Documentation System
The Advanced Documentation System is a document technology partner that helps optimize and ameliorate the work of the company’s printers. The costs spent on printers and their supply grow exponentially within years. There are various ways to improve the way printers are handled by implementing helpful services such as the Advanced Documentation System. The cost of the system depends on the brand, for instance on Capterra, the service costs $25 per month with a minimum of 5 working places which is $125 in total (Capterra, 2022). The software has a free trial period that allows the customer to understand the features of the system and its working specialties.
The usage of the system can become profitable for the company within time. It is a cost-saving service as it analyzes and teaches the personnel to use various printer regimes for various needs. The software teaches the customer to use the printer on a higher level and consequently leads to better document management including converting papers to digital and re-engineering procedures for better productivity. The service successfully integrates into the IT environment of the firm and optimizes the inner work processes.
Eventually, the implementation of the Advanced Documentation System can become an investment within time as it can save the time of the personnel, increase their productivity, and help the environment (Advanced Document Systems, 2022). The environmental-friendly approach is based on saving the print and the time printers are used by the personnel.
Alternative Funding Sources
The company can pay for the service using various financial resources for alternative funding resources. The sources usually depend on the scale of the firm, its level of income, and its current position in the market. The easiest and most accessible way to pay for Advanced Document System is from the cash flow, especially if the company has a surplus of profit. Some companies do not possess many employees and income, and they can take a bank loan to cover the costs of the system. The bank loan can also be helpful when the service is needed for many seats that have to be united and optimized. Then, the costs spent on the system increase, and extra funding might be needed.
To increase the cash flow, the company can also go to the equity market and issue the stocks. The more stocks are sold to shareholders, the more cash flow the firm receives and can use for different needs. The other way to find alternative funding sources is to issue bonds that represent a fixed-income instrument. A bond is a debt obligation meaning that the company loans from an investor a specific sum of money. Bonds are safe for investors and faster to get for the company because more people invest in bonds as a safer method. Finally, the company can use mixed funding to get the cash for the payment which means uniting several methods described above. All the funding opportunities are possible for buying and implementing the Advanced Documentation System."
"Blues-inspired poetry reflects the interaction between literary art and musical tradition that originates from the early 20 th century. Most researchers of this area, including Tracy (1981), state that blues-inspired poetry stems from the struggle and culture of African Americans. These people expressed their views and concerns through the music of blues, which quickly found a warm reception from the audience. Naturally, these aspects found their way into poetry, creating a unique style that combines the thematic elements of blues with the poetic tradition of literature. Blues poetry is stylistically similar to blues music in that it does not attempt to incorporate a variety of complex language forms and sophisticated rhymes. Instead, blues poetry is characterized by repetitive lines that emphasize the emotional burden of the author, as well as often simplified grammatic and lexical construction. Importantly, these attributes do not imply that blues poetry is simple or primitive by any means. On the contrary, these works are characterized by an extreme level of emotional depth, which is further multiplied by the realistic nature of the narration.
Blues poetry is a common feature of the first decades of the 20 th century and it is closely connected to the names of renowned authors of the time. More specifically, Tracy (1981) and other researchers highlight the contribution made by Langston Hughes and Sterling Brown who virtually defined the genre as it is. Nevertheless, blues poetry is not limited to their literary works, as a number of other authors contributed to the development of this style. Furthermore, blues poetry is found nowadays, as well, and the reason is that its themes are immortal. This genre addressed human struggle, pain, addiction, sexual relationships, and death, which are the topics that are not at all exclusive to the origins of blues poetry.
Having researched various works of the genre, I was particularly impressed by a piece that dates back to the 1920s. James Weldon Johnson (1927) created a poem that is titled Go Down, Death . As the name suggests, the piece thematically addresses the grief of a person over a beloved one. The recurring element of the poem goes like this:
“Weep not, weep not,
She is not dead;
She’s resting in the bosom of Jesus.”
Johnson mourns the death of a woman, attempting to console himself by searching divine meaning in the tragedy. He tells a story of how God himself sent Death after sister Caroline who was “tired” and “weary”. Apparently, the woman had her share of struggle in life, and now Johnson implies that God has decide to alleviate her of the burden. This piece is filled with tragedy and bittersweet hopefulness, conveying strong feelings through rather simple language. It is a highly interesting and recommended piece of blues poetry that reflects the depth of the genre.
You ain’t gonna see it coming, no
No one’s gonna see it coming
It comes unannounced in day or at night
All you can do is just sit here real tight
He wants to your granny, yeah
He wants to take your neighbor
Don’t think that you’re too cunning
Don’t think that you’re too clever
I saw him once and it was scary
I saw him once, yes, it was scary
He got me mumbling like I never did
‘What’s your name?’, I asked
and he said, ‘COVID’"
"It was genuinely surprising to read Gerai’s account about the Dayak community, as it seems to represent an almost utopian view on sex and gender. Unlike Western perspectives that seek to distinguish the two genders, and raise one up at the expense of the other in some ways, the Dayak recognize the differences but see it as a benefit. Reading the account, it almost seemed as the culture promotes the empowerement of both genders based on the characteristics which define them (i.e., male strength, female persistence). These positives are then brought together to contribute to the wellbeing of society as well as personal relationships in a nearly egalitarian perspectives.
It is difficult to believe, although greatly comforting to know that there are cultures as this. Unfortunately, most industrialized societies have the culture of severe gender clashes, and the characteristics of the gender are associated with negative aspects, such as Gerai notes, male strength is connected to aggression. I think it is correct to note that it is a matter of values, the values that are taught by society are the ones that people would exhibit. Western society gives value to hypermasculinity and aggression as definitions of males, exemplified via the genitalia and abusive actions such as sexual domination, assault or rape – therefore, the culture forms around this, being far removed from the egalitarianism and harmony of the Dayak.
As shocking as that perspective may be, I agree that it reflects accurately the social element that has been created conservatively around rape for centuries. As mentioned earlier, rape is often attributed to natural biology, while in reality it reflects more the concepts of society. I think this perspective touches on both, it emphasizes the natural characteristics of the genders (strength for men, femininity for women) while highlighting its social features (men are praised, women are viewed as used and broken). It can be argued that it is built within our society, as there are certain connotations and stereotypes associated with sexual violence. For example, in a UK study, the label victim was associated with passive femininity. The feminization hypothesis holds true when it comes to rape, as victims, that are most commonly women (but can be men) are attributed feminine characteristics and greater judgment (men would not be seen as men anymore). Meanwhile the accused of committing the rape is given trait dimension of prescriptive masculinity."
"“Bang Bang Baby” can be labeled a science fiction musical as it incorporates elements of both genres in an exciting plot. After watching the trailer first, I was surprised by the energetic nature of the music and the characters in the film. The main protagonist of the movie is a young lady named Stephy. She dreams about becoming a famous singer; however, her alcoholic father disapproves of her dreams. The story’s setting takes place in 1963 in a small Canadian town, and additionally, the movie is stylistically reminiscent of the 1950-1960s era in American pop music (Perone 34). The dresses, hairstyles, costumes, and decorations all point out the teddy-boy trend that was common in the 1950s.
However, after watching a film, it turned out to be a bitter and depressing experience as themes described in the movie are much more profound than they seem from a preview. First of all, the director managed to achieve the surrealistic and magical atmosphere by questioning the reality of the events through the scenes where Stephy wakes up from her dream. Sleep is used as one of the main transitional tools in the movie’s script as Stephy is sexually harassed when she falls asleep. Then she wakes up with Bobby Shore in her house, and the next time she wakes up in her bed, her whole life is different, and she is pregnant with a strange baby and sleeps with a man who raped her. Therefore, I think the film is about the maturity of Stephy and her sad story of letting go of her dreams of becoming a singer to the cruel external circumstances.
Besides that, the film is filled with charismatic dialogues and jokes, mainly coming from the famous singer Bobby Shore. He is a stylish young man who looks like Billie Joe Armstrong and Elvis Presley. He is quick-witted and slick, but somehow he feels shallow as his intentions are vague. However, one of my favorite jokes in the film comes from this character when he says, “Yeah, people love casinos. They are great for gambling addicts.” It is dark and cynical, but it dramatically represents the type of man Bobby Holiday is.
The music in the film plays a vital role as in every crucial point of the movie, the song starts. One of the most heartbreaking ones for me was when Stephy sings at the gas station when she finds out that all of her dreams are ruined and that she lives a life with a man she hates. Another remarkable thing is the purple fumes from the chemical plant near the city. Once they appear, everything in town and the life of Stephy becomes magical, and when the fumes clear, then everything comes back to the sad norm. The mutations of the city dwellers are grotesque, which represents a dream-like feeling of the movie. The camerawork in the film is also remarkable as it often uses the compositing techniques from movies of the 1940-1950s era."
"As an individual of mixed ethnicity, I have encountered instances of discrimination that have profoundly shaped my perspective on conversations about race and cultural identity. One incident remains etched in my memory, when a classmate made derogatory remarks about my cultural background, dismissing it as ""strange"" and ""inferior."" This encounter left me feeling vulnerable and isolated, but it also ignited a determination to engage in meaningful conversations about race and culture.
When faced with individuals holding negative views, I approach conversations with empathy and the intention to foster understanding rather than confrontation. I begin by acknowledging their right to their opinions while expressing my perspective in a calm and rational manner. By sharing personal experiences and fostering open dialogue, I strive to humanize the broader issues at hand, inviting empathy and introspection.
While changing someone's attitude can be an arduous task, I have witnessed instances where dialogue has created understanding. In a recent conversation, a close friend expressed ignorant stereotypes about my culture. Instead of retaliating, I engaged in an empathetic conversation, sharing my personal experiences and cultural nuances. Through patience and listening, my friend eventually exhibited a change in attitude, acknowledging the richness and diversity within my culture.
In conclusion, my experiences with discrimination based on ethnicity have shaped my approach to conversations about race and cultural identity. By fostering empathy, patiently explaining personal experiences, and promoting open dialogue, I believe change and understanding can be achieved. It is through these conversations that progress can be made towards a more inclusive and accepting society."
"The creation of a web-based system to store the university’s information on students and their transcripts presents certain risks that need to be addressed in the feasibility report. Using the standard risk evaluation process, it is possible to differentiate the risks into two large groups. These are risks to the continuation and completion of the project and risks to the end product’s performance after the project has been completed.
The risks to the continuation and completion of the project are as follows:
  * Unforeseen delays and time expenditures. It is possible that the project’s implementation will be more complex than anticipated, requiring more time;
  * Individuals participating in the project might become sick and slow down production;
  * The available hardware and software may malfunction.
The risks for the performance of the end product are as follows:
  * The product might not be secure enough to be allowed to work with personal student data;
  * The product would be economically unfeasible to run;
  * The product would not perform adequately to the university’s requirements.
Time-related problems could be identified by comparing the progress made with the timeline developed before starting the project. Functionality and requirements risks can be discovered by matching the product against its requirements for it, as well as through testing during specific project milestones. Potential time constraints and personnel/hardware breakages can be accounted for by allocating more time to the project than initially estimated to allow for replacements to be made. Countering the risks associated with site performance would be more difficult and largely have a reactionary nature, should some of them not be discovered and remedied during the product testing phase."
"Selection: “To Be Free” (2017)
  * Artist: Jamaal Barber
  * Art Form: Carved Wood Block
  * Time Period: 21st Century
Biographical Profile of Jamaal Barber
Jamaal Barber is a modern African American artist specializing in printmaking and woodcuts. The artist was born in Virginia and raised in Littleton, North Carolina (“Jamaal Barber”). He showed interest in art from a young age, fascinated by images in children’s and comic books. Then, Barber started drawing in elementary school and would draw on anything he could find (“Jamaal Barber”). However, Barber’s early passion would not lead him to become a full-time artist.
Barber’s major in college was business, but he switched it to art. Barber realized that he wanted “to make this art stuff work” when he had taken a “drawing class as an elective” (Johnson). Barber won several ECU student art awards during his years at East Carolina University. Notably, he won the JOSA Award of Excellence in Drawing in 2002 and got first place in the graphic design competition of the Rebel Magazine (“Jamaal Barber”). In 2003, Barber graduated from ECU with a bachelor’s degree in Communication Arts and took a 15-year break from studying to foster his personal view of artistry (“Jamaal Barber”; Johnson). In 2004, Barber moved to Atlanta, Georgia, and resides there with his wife and kids (“About”). The artist was actively creating during the break while working as a graphic designer for Iota Phi Theta Fraternity, Inc. and Spoken Magazine. His works have been displayed at the Ao5 Gallery and the Mano A Mano art show (“Jamaal Barber”).
Furthermore, Barber’s works have been published by Penguin Random House, Black Art in America, and Emory University, as well as on social media platforms and in the New York Times (“About”). From 2018, Barber went for a master’s degree in Printmaking at Georgia State University. His focus on printmaking began when he saw a demonstration on making a screen print at a local art store in 2013 (“About”). The artist’s prints and woodcuts are displayed at ZuCot Gallery and have been part of various art shows such as the Decatur Arts Festival and the Atlanta Print Biennial exhibit (“About”). In his works, Barber explores Black identity and showcases aspects of African American life (Johnson). His pieces are dynamic, thought-provoking, and experimental, depicting the perception of African Americans by themselves and society.
Critical Analysis of “To Be Free”
I selected one of Barber’s recent woodcuts because it showcases the social reality in which many African Americans live to date. The theme of the piece is the desire and struggle for freedom. The carving consists of a black man looking to his right and four white hands holding him by the shirt. The man’s expression is calm and thoughtful, indicating that he sees desired destination and is unconcerned with the impediment. He seems to be in motion: he starts moving towards the said destination. The hands are clenched and tense, stretching and nearly tearing the man’s clothing. It shows how they try to stop the man no matter what. The contrast between calmness and aggressiveness is striking and indicates a contest of persistence with the sheer power of reality. The artist has used a contrasting black and white palette that enhances said competition. Barber’s art piece from the same exhibition says: “Black is never neutral.” Interestingly enough, black is defined as a neutral color, but the artist makes it non-neutral in his piece. ‘To Be Free’ implies that black is a resistance surrounded by heavy and oppressing whiteness.
I think that Barber wants to show the hegemony of white America over the perception of black people. Tariq notes that Barber brings to light how “blackness is hyper-visible only when it is not seen as a threat to white wealth, power, privilege and safety.” The piece depicts how white society often attempts to dictate the freedom of a black person, employing discriminating views, stereotypes, and boundaries. Another implication that can be made is that the hands pulling the clothes will only receive the clothes. Historically, clothes were symbolic of status and caste in society. The man is determined to escape, and his body will not be taken, but he may lose his clothing. Here, the clothes seem to be the man’s false skin, the symbol of perception of himself and his place in society imposed by said society.
I would classify the piece as black art because it questions the harsh reality of African Americans in modern times. The exhibition is called Bright Black , and it revolves around what Barber sees as “the American Color Theory” and breaking “hegemonic modes of seeing” of black people by society (Tariq). Barber propagate African Americans to be strong and unflappable like the man on the carving. The will of the individual, the man, overshadows society’s discriminating imposition, the hands. They have grabbed a strong individual by his imposed identity, and the man has complete control over the situation. To be free, he needs to let go of so-called ‘hegemonic modes of seeing’ and be true to himself.
Selection: “Portrait of the Artist as a Shadow of His Former Self” (1980)
  * Artist: Kerry James Marshall
  * Art Form: Paper Painting
  * Time Period: Postmodernism/New Blackness
Biographical Profile of Kerry James Marshall
Kerry James Marshall is an African American painter and printmaker. He was born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1955 (Yood). The artist is known for his unique style, representing ordinary people and questioning social dogmas. Marshall studied at the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles and got his Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1978 (Yood). Marshall used a collage technique in his early works and was actively creating in the 1970s. However, the turning point for his career came in 1980 with the ‘Portrait of the Artist as a Shadow of His Former Self’ (Easter). It was the first of Marshall’s famous black figures that have become characteristic of his style.
Marshall has been living in Chicago most of his life. He moved there with his future wife, Cheryl Lynn Bruce, in 1987 after he finished a residency for the Studio Museum in Harlem. In Chicago, he worked as a professor at the University of Illinois from 1993 to 2006 (Yood). During this period, the artist made numerous paintings and series depicting the life and culture of African Americans and the social issues they face and received several awards. MacArthur Foundation gave Marshall’ Genius Grant’ in 1997, and Otis Art Institute awarded him with an honorary doctorate in 1999 (Yood). Other honors include a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts (1991), Wolfgang Hahn Prize (2014), Rosenberger Medal (2016), Chicago’s Fifth Star Award (2017) and WEB. Du Bois Medal (2019) (“Kerry James Marshall: Biography”). In 2013, Marshall was appointed to the President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities. The artist has been widely praised for his influence on US culture and art.
Marshall’s works have been exhibited not only in the US but in Europe too. Numerous museums and art centres in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Washington, San Francisco, Minneapolis, and Boston hold his paintings in their collections. For example, Chicago’s Museum of Contemporary Art or Washington’s National Gallery (“Kerry James Marshall: Biography”). Other well-known institutions throughout the US have been organizing solo shows since the late 1990s. Abroad exhibitions have been held in Vancouver, Vienna, London, Kassel, Venice, Antwerp, Copenhagen, Barcelona, and Madrid. The most prominent displays were Documenta in Kassel in 1997 and 2007, the Venice Biennale in 2003, and David Zwirner in London in 2014 and 2018 (Yood; “Kerry James Marshall: Biography”). Additionally, the artist was commissioned to create a grand mural for the High Line in 2015. Such presence in museums and galleries and the number of awards and honors clearly show an immense contribution that Marshall has made to the art world and for the representation of African Americans worldwide.
Critical Analysis of “Portrait of the Artist as a Shadow of His Former Self”
I chose one of the most famous works by Marshall, ‘Portrait of the Artist , ’ because it is crucial for the development of the artist’s unique style and thematic focus on African American life and culture. The painting is a metaphorical depiction of white America’s unfair perception of black people. The artist painted the ‘self-portrait’ on a tiny piece of paper (8 by 6½ inches) using egg tempera (Easter). The painting depicts a black figure looking at the viewer with a big toothy smile. The figure wears a black hat and coat and stands over a black background. The piece is predominantly black with some grey-white for shirt, teeth, eyes, and dark red for gums.
The smallness of the piece creates an interesting illusion. First, while at some distance, the viewer sees only blackness with some white spots. The shirt, eyes, and devilish grin become visible, moving a little closer. Finally, shades of black emerge, and the shadow becomes a smiling person in dark clothing. Moreover, the smile no longer seems malevolent or mischievous; the person is cheerful, and the image is perceived as optimistic. Easter argues that some might see a connection between the piece and the racist practice of blackface, but Marshall, most probably, did not intend to make such connections. The artist painted a black figure over a black background to show how individuals may be present but ignored by others. This concept is relevant today more than ever as societies, groups of people or individuals tend to ignore those they deem unworthy based on some biases, which is discrimination at its core.
Marshall was inspired by Ralph Ellison’s novel Invisible Man written in 1952. Ralph Ellison explores “the harsh indignities of being a black in America,” being virtually non-existent in the eyes of white people because of skin color (Easter). Furthermore, ‘Portrait of the Artist’ was Marshall’s experiment with black paint. White notes how black is “as chromatically rich as every other color on the spectrum” in Marshall’s works (as cited in Easter). The experiment’s success gave the world dozens of brilliant paintings that depict the richness of African American culture and raise awareness about issues that African Americans face daily. That is why I believe that ‘Portrait of the Artist’ is an important contribution to black art."

"The rhythmic accounting rap song Debit Credit Theory by Colin Dodds (n.d.) is an excellent way to remember that debit’s location is the left side of the account, and credit’s location is the right one. This unusual song also explains the meaning of these two terms. This fun but an educational source has enabled me to remember the material and not get confused in the concepts.

The mnemonic offered by Heather McNellis (2020) also contributes to better understanding and remembering the essence of debit and credit and the account balances. The DEAL/CLIP mnemonic contains the explanation of debit’s and credit’s parts. Due to this engaging technic, it is pretty easy to understand that while debit includes Drawings, Expenses, Assets, and Losses, credit consists of Capital, Liabilities, Income, as well as Profits.

I have chosen these two sources since they make it easy to remember accounting basics. They are pretty bright, fun, and engaging: due to the song chorus, it is impossible to forget where debit and credit are located, and mnemonics help remember all their constituents. I think other students will also like them since they are suitable for people with different types of information perception.
How Would You Define Ethics?
Ethics is a set of norms of behavior adopted in society or any social group.
What are Three Factors that Might Affect Good Ethical Conduct?
The factors influencing ethical conduct are divided into three levels: individual, involving the personal values, social, or organizational, including norms of the organization, and opportunity ones that are situations requiring ethical or unethical decisions.
An Explanation of Why the Sarbanes-Oxley Act Was Created
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was created to make it impossible for managers and accountants to misuse funds. It resulted from high-profile scandals with corporate reporting, due to which investors began to doubt the reliability of the data provided by companies. This Act also relates to ethics since it contains the set of norms and principles of fair leading a business.
What Are the Legal Liabilities of an Accountant?
The accountant is responsible for maintaining all financial calculations of the company, as well as the reliability of data, and they are liable for misstatements and mistakes made by them. However, the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles claim the employee is not responsible for misstatements if they work in good faith."
"Introduction
In every healthcare setting, the need to meet optimal patient care requires nurses to maintain ethical practices and follow the outlined principles effectively. The relationship between the sick individual, relative, and practitioner is vital for ensuring better services to the ailing person. In most cases, nurses are faced with technical situations that require them to make sensible decisions while taking into consideration the welfare of the client and family members (Bratz & Sandoval-Ramirez, 2018).
Such challenging moments call for the caregivers to critically apply the principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and justice to ensure they optimally attend to the customers appropriately. Morals allow nurses to detect ethical dilemmas in the work environment and make sound judgments and practical decisions according to their values and beliefs while maintaining their conduct within the laws that govern their profession.
Based on the current health status of Mr. Newcomb, I would approve the request to meet his mistress. First, Mr. Newcomb is at a critical stage of pancreatic cancer, and having in mind all the pain he is going through; it would be appropriate to consider his wish. Currently, he is under hospice care, where the main focus is to ensure he receives quality time and comfort experience before his death time. At this point, anything that makes Mr. Newcomb happy matters most for his life. He needs something that can make him happy to lengthen his days.
Disapproving the request would diminish the trust Mr. Newcomb has in me, and he will probably start withdrawing his attention from my services, which will be disastrous for his health. Therefore, to maintain the connection and ensure he receives quality care, I would ensure his desires are met. The practice will be good for the patient’s health, but for his wife, it would sound like a betrayal. As a nurse, I will make it secret after inquiring about the relationship between Mr. Newcomb and the mistress from him. Once I realize the relationship is healthy, I will formulate a way of allowing the patient to meet his friend.
Principle of Beneficence
In healthcare, the principle of beneficence requires a nurse to be kind and act in a way that benefits the patient. Caregivers are expected to support the welfare of sick individuals by preventing any harm while preserving moral rules (Giles et al., 2018). In the case of Mr. Newcomb, he wanted to meet his mistress, and the action would bring him joy and happiness that, in return, improved his health condition. Allowing interaction between the patient and the visitor is an act that follows the moral of beneficence. At the same time, keeping it a secret from their wife is protecting him from guilt and fear that would cause his status to deteriorate abnormally, reducing the number of his days to live.
Principle of Non-Maleficence
The principle of non-maleficence prohibits nurse practitioners from engaging in any action intentionally that can harm the patient. Based on the case of Mr. Newcomb, rejecting his request would cause him stress and pain following the sensitiveness of the wish. Therefore, finding a means of giving him a chance to meet the mistress would be of great help to his care. I already knew that refusing to grant the permission would result in more traumas for the patient; hence, if I declined intentionally, my practice would be against the principle of non-maleficence (Ilkafah et al., 2021). If I weigh the burdens of denying and granting the opportunity, accepting the request presents more benefits to the welfare of Mr. Newcomb, which is necessary for his hospice care management.
Principle of Autonomy
The principle of autonomy allows patients to make independent decisions concerning their needs. According to the scenario of Mr. Newcomb, he had the right to moral practice. Therefore, it is ethical to allow him to exercise his capacity of sovereignty. Upon hearing the patient’s request, I would have to assess his ability to carry on with the wish. If he is capable, then the principle applies, and the individual explores his self-determination. When I allowed Mr. Newcomb to meet his mistress following his decision, I adhered to the practice of autonomy to improve patient care services.
Principle of Justice
In nursing, the principle of justice requires nurses to practice fairness, equitability, and equality for all patients. The moral promotes recognition of a sick person’s dignity irrespective of their status (Silva & Oliveira, 2020). According to the scenario of Mr. Newcomb, I would apply the standard by allowing him to meet his mistress. The practice would follow the requirement of justice, which is to be fair to the patient. Displaying justice would indicate care to the victim hence enhancing his emotional strength towards the services he is receiving within the facility.
Beliefs and Values
Generally, personal beliefs and values play a vital role in influencing ethical practice in the work setting. Education, past experience, and culture are key factors that significantly determine how an individual portrays moral behaviors (Sari et al., 2018). I believe in the provision of care for people in need, and the concept has been of great help when it comes to solving dilemmas. According to Mr. Newcomb’s scenario, my decision was greatly influenced by the value of caring, which prompted me to do what was possible to help him relieve the constant pain. Based on my nursing experience, if you prevent patients from what they wish to have, they become depressed and lose trust in the care provider. Therefore, apart from the principles of ethical conduct, my beliefs and values would form part of the decision I make about a patient’s welfare.
Strategies for Promoting Self-Care
Generally, nurses engage in different activities to ensure patients receive the best care services within the facility. It is their responsibility to ensure sick individuals’ well-being is achieved. Their duty requires maximum concentration and focus on ensuring they deliver optimal care to patients. They, therefore, need proper strategies to enable them to improve patients’ self-care to enhance the quality and safety of their health (Wang et al., 2019). The practice allows patients to have good physical and mental health while undergoing medication to enable them to overcome the stress and pain of the disease. Some techniques, such as regular exercise, maintaining friends, and healthy eating habits, facilitate self-care among patients.
Practicing Healthy Eating Habit
Different categories of meals patients consume have impacts on their health. Nurses should ensure a sick person has a proper balance diet to help build their immune system. They should also make sure sugary foods are not given to the patient because of their adverse effects. Healthy eating habits would allow patients to have enough energy necessary for their physical fitness. Caregivers should encourage patients to consume foodstuffs that would help them have better growth.
Regular Exercise
Practicing regular physical exercise is essential for the health of a patient. Nurses should advise sick individuals to have a planned routine for engaging in bodily activities. The practice would ensure patients reduce anxiety, depression, and trauma caused by the disorder. Furthermore, during the exercises, patients would feel engaged, thus increasing their concentration and happiness. Implementing simple workouts would keep their bodies fit and strong to withstand the agony of the illness.
Maintaining Friendships
Sick persons require a high sense of belonging to make them feel loved hence eliminating stigmatization. Nurses should encourage patients to interact with their loved ones frequently to ensure they feel part of them irrespective of their health condition. Furthermore, having a close connection would lower stress levels and make them become strong and happy. The practice would make patients feel free and remain determined throughout the provision of care services.
Conclusion
In summary, it is essential for nurses to embrace ethics in their work to ensure they deliver the best care services to the patients. Such principles as beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and justice are critical in helping care providers make sound decisions when faced with a dilemma. Therefore, it is important for practitioners to adhere to the practices to enable them to work within the laws that govern nursing. In addition, following numerous activities that health providers perform, they require proper strategies to help them improve their self-care. Such approaches as healthy eating habits, maintaining a friendship, and physical exercise are vital in enhancing patients’ self-care."

"Family relations are becoming increasingly important in the modern world. This cell of society has the opportunity to form the most favorable conditions for future generations. That is why it is necessary to research and find ways to solve problems, difficulties and disagreements between husbands and wives. This is also critically important due to the fact that even at present, the deterioration of family ties will negatively affect not only society, but also the psychological and physical health of individuals (Salinger and Whisman, 2021). At the moment, the Western model of marital relations is particularly widespread, where the relationship is based on friendliness and taking into account the person’s personality as the most important indicator. It is important to note the fact that the relationship between spouses is a direct reflection of the trends in the development of society. This is due to the fact that social conditions are constantly changing and transforming, presenting new requirements to the institution of the family. Hence, recently, the roles of husband and wife have been changing in values. There are often cases where a woman becomes the breadwinner of the family and assumes all responsibility, becoming a leader. However, an integral part of the union of men and women is following religious concepts. Moreover, faith emphasizes the preservation of traditional ideological values. The way people will relate to faith can be passed on to the next generations, which will have both a positive and non-negative character. That is why it is necessary to grow children taking into account religion based on mutual understanding, love and empathy.
Modern society, despite its rapid development, is characterized by a sufficient number of social problems. The need to solve them is to improve people’s relationships for the further well-being of other generations. Hence, one of the important questions is the survey of marital relations and issues that may arise in them. It should be noted that in this aspect, the importance of religion and its postulates plays an important role. Thus, this work examines the problems of matrimony, the ways to solve them and the use of faith for a better understanding of the problem.
Therefore, more and more literature and scientific works appear on the topic of the relationship between husband and wife. Moreover, special attention is paid to their influence both on social life and on the psychological and physical condition of the spouses (Masoumi et al., 2017). The family as an institution of society occupies one of the central places, therefore it is characterized by increased interest from researchers in various fields. Similarly, this aspect attracts religion into its component, since it can become both a way of uniting spouses and a cause of disagreement. Despite this, most of the studies prove the positive influence of faith on this type of people’s relationships.
For these reasons, it is necessary to fully understand the marital relationship, which is characterized by constant changes over time. It is also influenced by such external factors as modernization and globalization. To a greater extent, they influenced the development of the concept of a friendly marriage, which has the features of a partnership relationship, where both parts consciously approach solving many issues and understanding what is happening. However, even in this case, negative and stressful situations may arise that require timely solutions and a sober attitude (Masoumi et al., 2017). Moreover, such healthy relationships are described by a high degree of closeness of spouses, a special level of affection, mutual understanding and empathy.
The development of technology and changes in social values have a special effect on the institution of marriage. Hence, in modern society, there is such a type of nuclear family, where a man is engaged in mining to ensure the material side of the family, and a woman is more often engaged in preserving the hearth and caring for children. However, it is also possible to have families where these roles change and the woman is engaged in earnings, and the man is engaged in household aspects. In addition, the Western family model is spreading all over the world, where the main component is just the same friendly relations, and then romantic ones.
Therefore, the modern Western model of the family is characterized by a focus on the personality of the partners, and not on the economic or status component. Unlike past experience, in society, first of all, people choose their life partners based on certain qualities, and then according to the level of wealth and position. Moreover, the age gap between generations is growing, which complicates the relationship between, for example, children and parents. This is due to the shift in the pace of formation and establishment of the individual. Family values and patterns of behavior are also changing, adaptation to which may cause some disagreements and issues. The leader in the family is not always the male breadwinner, which also has its own special influence.
A stable and satisfying marriage can become an important source of emotional and instrumental support throughout adult life. In addition, it is associated with increased economic well-being, mental and physical health (Rajabi et al., 2020). Some of these obvious advantages of marriage may be the result of improved health behavior among married people, care and control by a spouse, or, first of all, the selection of the healthiest, happiest and economically well-off men and women in stable marriages. Although the exact nature of the processes leading to these positive outcomes is not entirely clear, marriage is associated with important benefits for older Americans.
It is worth noting that the close relationship between spouses is based on emotional support and trust. It is these aspects that will contribute to such a concept as a healthy marriage. The difference of interests in a couple can also become a way of bonding. Even if they are different, the main thing is to enjoy each other’s company. Moreover, a healthy relationship between husband and wife is a means of well-being and makes it possible to effectively manage emerging stresses. Conflict situations and problems in this case do not disappear anywhere, but they can be solved much faster and manifest themselves much less often. Moreover, when dealing with different isuues, spouses are even more united and can bring more benefits to society.
Thus, as already mentioned, stressful situations are inevitable and their solution is sometimes quite difficult. One of these problems may be the financial side of creating and maintaining a family. This issue is more often mentioned in the sources and may have one of the most harmful effects. It is noted that disputes over money often conceal the desire to have power over the cell of society. Moreover, it can be caused by different views on the family structure and values that one of the spouses has formed during the formation of personality. Thus, this problem increases the occurrence of difficulties, negatively affecting the psychological state of the husband or wife.
The next problem is everything related to the birth and upbringing of children. These family members generally always contribute to increasing tension in the family, especially at the stages of preparation for parenthood and in the first period of caring for offspring. On the other hand, children in family relationships can significantly affect the cohesion, improvement of their responsibilities and care (Mahoney et al., 2021). With the advent of new family shuttles, however, the spouses manage to pay less and less attention to each other, which also causes conflicts and disputes.
Daily stress in everyday life also has its contribution. Sometimes. It may be insignificant, but over time, tension can accumulate and become the result of a strong conflict. Under such conditions, it is important to see the irritated or depressed state of the partner. This will help to regulate stress and avoid possible consequences. Successful stress management promotes the development of emotional support skills, which will help with a possible recurrence of the situation.
The next problem that needs to be mentioned is the lack of time. It can be caused by many factors, but most often occurs due to the work schedule of one of the spouses. This situation affects not only the mental, but also the physical health of the spouses. A husband and wife may feel alienated and deprived of their former strong bond. Because of this, an issue of communication problems may leak out, which will disrupt the dynamics of the functioning of the family institution. Sometimes, analyzing the interaction of spouses based on their way of communication can immediately make it clear whether their marriage will last or not. The positive side is the fact that all of the above problems can be easily solved. If attempts to fix the situation on their own fail, many couples can turn to the help of family therapy. This aspect of working with a specialist, as if by an outside spectator, will help to come to a balanced decision and change the spouses’ ideas about the importance and criticality of any problem.
Religion and theology also pay considerable attention to how the institution of family relations develops in modern society. Thus, research comes to the conclusion that faith can contribute to both improvement and deterioration of the situation in the family (Kelley et al., 2020). A special place should be given to religion in the issue under study, since without God there is no real and sincere humanity in people, thereby proper relationships cannot be formed. Thus, based on the postulates of faith, it is possible to deepen and improve the understanding of such a social phenomenon as family relations and their problems. Moreover, this knowledge contributes to a more effective analysis of changes in this institution over time and the identification of future trends in its development. Without taking into account religious aspects, people risk getting rid of the understanding of the main values and the role of creating a family, which will have a negative impact in the future.
On the part of theology, in contrast to more methodical data, three main points can be distinguished in family relations. Certain roles must be formed between the spouses, which were prescribed to them by the Almighty. This type of relationship requires the creation of bonds of dependence and service between the wife and husband. Further, these vocations of the spouses have a justification in the grace of Jesus himself, which determines the essence of the marital relationship. It also helps to cope better with conflict situations and brings a man and a woman closer to faith. In addition, the conclusion of marriage ties implies the creation of a community of love and life, forming a kind of home church. However, due to the fact that this aspect is increasingly ignored in modern society, many difficulties arise. Due to the distance of people from faith, the moment of spirituality disappears and a moral distortion of society arises.
Moreover, there is an increasing tendency among men and women to dissolve marital ties. This is due to the rejection of religious values, whether it is the faith of one of the spouses or the complete absence of it from the husband and wife. It is worth agreeing that religion and spirituality do not have such a significant role in the formation of romantic relationships, but in the future they should gain more power and authority. If people overlook this fact, the situation in the family can significantly worsen and lead to undesirable consequences (Aman et al., 2019). in the longer term, spiritual contradictions can worsen, expand and undermine romanticism in relationships. Taking into account religion can give partners the opportunity to unite and avoid the occurrence of stressful cases.
It is worth noting that the religious views of parents in the future strongly affect their children. This fact is especially valuable because it has a role in shaping future generations and how the society of the future will view religion. Thus, families where concepts such as pacification, harmony and mutual support in religious matters are neglected, much more issues occur. In other cases, children and parents find a source of peace and interest at the same time, depriving family members to commit sinful acts. Among the practices that must be had in every family, holding a joint prayer is noted, which has a beneficial effect (King et al., 2020)health. Thus, the members of this cell of society form a sense of cohesion and a goal to achieve and strive for the best for the benefit of each other.
Therefore, the study and analysis of family relations is of valuable importance. This activity will contribute to a deeper and clearer understanding of this public institution and minimize the occurrence of problems related to marriage. Naturally, the creation of a family is accompanied by many difficulties, but with a sober look at the relationship between husband and wife, it will help to solve them in a timely and effective manner. Moreover, regardless of methodological research and data, it is important to take into account such an aspect as religion. It plays an important role in family relations, as it contributes to the creation of cohesion and mutual understanding in the family."
"Introduction:
The emergence and subsequent rise of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka marked a turbulent period in the country's history. This essay will explore the ideology, leadership, violent methods, and ultimate defeat of the LTTE, while analyzing their motivations, goals, and impact on the international stage. Additionally, it will examine the group's connections to other terrorist organizations, shedding light on the effects of Sri Lankan conflicts on gender inequality and targeted violence, focusing on the abduction and exploitation of children. Lastly, the factors that led to the LTTE's downfall, including their financial resources and weapon sales, will be critically assessed.
Body:
1. Emergence, Ideology, and Leadership of the LTTE:
The LTTE emerged in the 1970s, driven by the desire to establish a separate Tamil homeland in the northern and eastern regions of Sri Lanka. Their ideology, characterized by Tamil nationalism and separatism, aimed to address the longstanding grievances of the Tamil minority population against perceived discrimination by the Sinhalese majority. Under the leadership of Velupillai Prabhakaran, the LTTE effectively mobilized Tamil youths, established a de facto state, and conducted a ruthless armed struggle against the Sri Lankan government.
2. Violent Methods and Impact on the International Stage:
The LTTE's use of violent methods, such as suicide bombings, guerrilla warfare, and targeted assassinations, played a significant role in their international reputation as a formidable terrorist organization. Their violent tactics escalated the conflict, resulting in a devastating toll on both sides, as well as significant international concern. The group's effective propaganda machinery exposed the Sri Lankan conflict to global audiences, garnering sympathy and support from Tamil diaspora communities worldwide.
3. Connections to Other Terrorist Organizations:
The LTTE's connections to other terrorist organizations, particularly its alleged links to groups like Hezbollah and Al-Qaeda, raised concerns about the global reach of Tamil separatism. While some evidence suggests limited operational ties, the LTTE primarily focused on acquiring weapons and training from sympathetic countries without direct association to global radical ideologies. Nevertheless, their networking provided their cause with international validation and funded their activities.
4. Effects of Sri Lankan Conflicts on Gender Inequality and Targeted Violence:
The armed conflict in Sri Lanka had severe consequences for gender equality and targeted violence. The LTTE forcibly recruited child soldiers, often subjecting them to torture and sexual exploitation. Women, too, played significant roles within the organization, although often in subordinate positions. Furthermore, sexual violence against both men and women became prevalent during the conflict, perpetuating a culture of fear and violence.
5. Downfall of the LTTE:
The downfall of the LTTE can be attributed to various factors. Firstly, Sri Lanka's military, aided by international support, waged an aggressive military campaign against the group, ultimately bringing an end to their control over significant territories. Secondly, the loss of international support weakened the LTTE both economically and in terms of arms procurement. Finally, the LTTE's overreliance on illicit activities, such as arms smuggling and narcotics trade, limited their strategic options and decreased their public support.
Conclusion:
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) emerged in Sri Lanka with a powerful ideology and violent methods, seeking to establish a separate Tamil homeland. Despite their international impact and connections to other terrorist organizations, their violent tactics and human rights abuses led to their downfall. The conflict also exposed rampant gender inequality and targeted violence, with children particularly affected by abduction and exploitation. Ultimately, the LTTE's defeat can be attributed to a combination of military intervention, loss of international support, and their own mismanagement of resources. As Sri Lanka recovers from the conflict, addressing these issues remains crucial for lasting peace and reconciliation. (Word count: 800)"
"Supply chains can be highly vulnerable to hacking and malware attacks and, depending on the attacker’s motivation, are susceptible to actions aimed at stealing large amounts of money and disrupting business. Yeniyurt and Carnovale (2021) note that cybercriminals are unwilling to slow down the growth of cyber threats and invent new ways to steal information from individuals and organizations of all sizes. The most common cyber risks in supply chain management include data breaches, supply chain disruption, and malware attacks. Data breaches can occur through external and internal intruders. Employees, hackers, malicious competitors, and managers can leak sensitive data and personal information outside the business. Supply chain disruption occurs when a hacker or attacker breaks into an operating system or network without permission. The goal of penetration is to create havoc on the system by deleting, replicating, and corrupting data. Malware attacks can occur with the help of ransomware that blocks the computer until the company pays a certain amount of money.
One of the cyberattack tools is sending a phishing email in order to obtain information. Ghadge et al. (2020) assert that clicking on a link in an email may result in data corruption and loss. If the phishing email is successful, the company can find the username and password used externally to collect information on the system. It can lead to unforeseen competition and serious leaks that could harm the entire corporation.
The sophistication of attacks and the complexity of modern IT, using such technologies as virtualization, mobile, and cloud computing, are forcing companies to improve the protection of their information and apply defense-in-depth technologies. According to Gaudenzi and Siciliano (2018), to successfully address cyber risks, a serious cyber and IT risk management strategy is needed that considers various corporate functions. High IT security standards for networks, software, and mobile devices, staff awareness training, ongoing process optimization, and strict access rights management and guidelines help to combat the above cyber risks. In turn, cyber risk insurance is becoming a major factor in IT risk management for many companies to manage residual risks.
A cyber-attack on a company’s supply chain is not only a short-term problem, but it also has medium and long-term consequences. First, cyber-attacks lead to the loss of external information. Cybercriminals obtain information belonging to the platform’s users, which is supposed to be a secure environment. Secondly, cyber-attacks also lead to the loss of inside information. It is a serious problem for the company as its corporate information security will be severely compromised. It may suffer from the theft of internal data or confidential information that is vital to the company’s daily operations.
Thirdly, cyber-attacks lead to the deterioration of the company’s reputation. If users have their data stolen from an external platform, then they are unlikely to trust this platform in the future. Fourth, cyber-attacks lead to serious sanctions for the company. While there is no comprehensive national privacy law in the United States, there are several sector-specific data privacy and security laws at the federal level. Moreover, there are many other state and local privacy laws. Thus, the relevant authorities closely monitor companies that violate these requirements. One of the consequences of identity theft can be the recognition that the company has violated the law, as a result of which it may face multimillion-dollar fines."

While the portrayal of women in Greek society often confined them to domestic roles and restricted their involvement in public affairs, certain female characters and goddesses challenged these norms. By comparing and contrasting the portrayal of women and gods in ancient Greek culture, it becomes evident that while women grappled within the confines of societal restrictions, the gods often embodied more complex and divergent qualities."
"There are always multiple obstacles that can significantly diminish the overall efficiency of any project plan. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze all the factors that may stay behind potential barriers to its successful implementation. Given the complexity of the project plan and the holistic approach expected to prevail in all stages of its fulfillment, there are numerous spheres that may be exposed to certain risks. Significant changes that affect the organizational structure of an institution always lead to various issues ranging from increased expenditures to employees’ diminished motivation and resistance to changes. A dedicated analysis is needed in order to find the most appropriate solutions to problems that may arise.
One of the essential issues that should be addressed while implementing the plan is centered around the employees’ perception of the efficiency and urgent nature of the changes that the project plan implies. Therefore, it is of significant importance to provide all employees that may be affected with a substantial body of evidence proving the benefits to a hospital in general. It is crucial to underpin the strong correlation between a hospital’s performance and employees’ salaries.
Given the importance of measures listed in the project plan, the only issue that might make employees anxious is their pay. Factors such as lack of cooperation among the medical team, lack of motivation in nurses, lack of a holistic approach, and lack of support organizations could be barriers to holistic care (Babaei & Taleghani, 2019). Therefore, employees that are most likely to be exposed to increased amounts of stress should be comforted with the available data on the ultimately positive outcomes of the changes.
The next barrier that can significantly undermine the way the desired changes are implemented is related to deadlines. Although the project plan contains estimates of the time that is necessary for each step, it is clear that numerous unforeseen factors may result in delays. Therefore, it is crucial to provide extra guidelines that will explain to employees all the details of combining old and new methods. Sipes (2020) claims that nursing education did not have informatics competencies; thus, current managers, administrators, or NEs may not be fully prepared to lead or use change in the use of health information technology. Therefore, encouraging employees to actively participate in the implementation of different stages of the plan and teaching them basic IT skills should also be considered instrumental for the eventual success.
Different new strategies and approaches should be used while implementing the project plan. White et al. (2021) name careful planning, execution, evaluation, and broad dissemination among the measures that are instrumental for a successful outcome. Dang et al. (2021) pinpoint the increased importance of dissemination plans, audience-specific recommendations for internal and external dissemination venues, pros and cons of different types of dissemination. Thus, collecting data and evidence continue to play a crucial role in mitigating potential barriers.
There are multiple barriers that may undermine the rapid and efficient implementation of the project plan. Nevertheless, solutions provided in this work allow for an enhanced understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the plan and may eventually contribute to future changes. Therefore, it is vital to stick to the original plan that includes stipulations on the required actions if specific difficulties arise. Nevertheless, additional efforts are needed to secure the payments, keep employees engaged and motivated, and provide precise guidelines for cases when deadlines cannot be met."
"As a matter of fact, one of the most comprehensive definitions of marketing was given by the American Marketing Association (AMA). According to it, marketing is “the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large” (AMA, n.d., para. 2). Although all components of the marketing form consumers’ demands, they are also affected by their free choice."
"Introduction (100 words):
The Mexican-American War of 1846-1848 marked a historical turning point in the relationship between Mexico and the United States. However, it also served as the catalyst for the stigmatization, discrimination, and vilification of Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans. This essay aims to discuss how the war heightened negative stereotypes, such as laziness and criminality, of Mexican immigrants, which in turn influenced attitudes towards Mexican Americans. It will further analyze the overarching impact of the annexation of Texas on the relationship between both nations and the subsequent desire of Mexican Americans to conceal their Mexican ancestry.
Body Paragraph 1 - Impact on Stereotyping and Discrimination (100 words):
The outcome of the Mexican-American War led to a sense of bitterness and resentment among American citizens towards Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans. A prevailing stereotype that emerged was the portrayal of Mexicans as lazy and criminal. Media and popular culture fueled this stigmatization, deepening discriminatory attitudes towards them. These negative stereotypes were rooted in historical context and were perpetuated to justify the mistreatment and marginalization of Mexican immigrants, further fueling anti-Mexican sentiment.
Body Paragraph 2 - Impact on Attitudes Towards Mexican Americans (100 words):
The portrayal of Mexican immigrants as lazy and criminal not only shaped public opinion towards them but also extended to Mexican Americans. As a result, Mexican Americans faced heightened discrimination and hostility in various aspects of their lives, including employment, housing, and education. The vilification of Mexican immigrants invariably affected the broader perception of Mexican Americans as inherently undesirable and untrustworthy, creating a climate of marginalization and exclusion for generations to come.
Body Paragraph 3 - Impact of Annexation on Relationship and Mexican American Identity (100 words):
The annexation of Texas had a profound impact on the relationship between Mexico and the United States. The loss of Mexican territory intensified the already strained relations and harbored sentiments of resentment and bitterness. As a consequence, many Mexican Americans felt the need to distance themselves from their Mexican heritage and hide their ancestry in order to protect themselves from discrimination and ensure social and economic opportunities. The annexation heightened the materialization of a distinct and multifaceted Mexican American identity rooted in the struggle for acceptance and social mobility.
Conclusion (100 words):
The Mexican-American War and the annexation of Texas profoundly influenced the stigmatization and discrimination faced by Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans. The portrayal of Mexicans as lazy and criminal following the war led to the perpetuation of negative stereotypes and prejudices that continue to affect Mexican Americans today. The annexation solidified a fraught relationship between the two nations and contributed to the desire of Mexican Americans to conceal their Mexican ancestry as a strategic choice for survival and social advancement. Addressing and challenging these stigmas and prejudices is essential for creating a more inclusive society that embraces the diversity and inherent worth of all its members."
"It should be noted that the Undercover Boss episode of Rita’s Ice showcases the interaction of the company CEO, Linda L. Chadwick, with several of her franchisees. The selected job positions for the analysis are franchisee owner and treat team member. The first job position is franchisee owner based on the example of Hezrron, and the second one is a treat team member position based on the example of Pastiche.
The analysis shows that the first job position requires a wide range of entrepreneurial skills and abilities since the franchise owner is practically a business owner who needs to adhere to the corporate standards. The second position is solely focused on cashier responsibilities, which puts an emphasis on human interactions as well as the ability to conduct financial transactions. The similarity of the two positions is manifested in the fact that financial competence and communication skills are critical in both cases. However, the first position also requires additional operational and organizational management capabilities. The data collection for each job position analysis utilizes one-on-one interviews on-site, which means that both practical observations and additional questioning can be done. The key challenges and issues can also be derived on site since the interview is being conducted while the job positions are being performed.

"Patients at any point need an advanced care and proper safety at all times. According to the Joint Commission, hospitals should focus on seven patient safety goals for 2021 (Clarkson, 2021). The organization uses new evidence on emerging patient safety issues to inform its goals for the coming year. This data inspires other Joint Commission Center for Transforming Healthcare initiatives and teaching materials. Listed below are some of the hospital’s goals and how they align. When delivering care, treatment, and services, make sure to use at least two methods of identifying the patient. Misdiagnosis and mistreatment of patients can occur at any stage of the process.
First, the person for whom the service or treatment is intended must be reliably recognized. A person’s name, a government-issued ID number, a phone number, or other unique identifier is permitted. Unable to speak, babies have fewer identifying characteristics (Clarkson, 2021). Misidentification led to serving a mother’s breastmilk to the wrong newborn, posing a danger of transmitting bodily fluids and possible diseases to the newborn. In this case, all providers must use the same identifying scheme.
In perioperative and other procedural settings, mark all medications, medication containers, and other solutions entering or leaving the sterile field. A syringe is a medication container, while medicine cups and basins are others. Unlabeled containers of medications or other solutions make it impossible to track down the contents. Mistakes occur when drugs and other solutions have been transferred from their original containers to unmarked containers, some of which have been catastrophic. Despite the dangers of this approach, it is a commonplace in many businesses and organizations. Safe medication management requires the labeling of all medications and the containers in which they are stored. This procedure tackles a well-known risk factor in the delivery of drugs in perioperative and other procedural settings.
Reduce the risk of anticoagulant therapy-related harm to patients. Prophylactic anticoagulation for preventing venous thromboembolism in regular settings does not meet these criteria (for example, related to procedures or hospitalization) (Clarkson 2021). Anticoagulation is used to treat several conditions, but the most prevalent include atrial fibrillation, DVT, PE, and mechanical heart valve implant. Complications in administration, monitoring, and patient compliance make anticoagulants more harmful than other drugs. This National Patient Safety Goal may also improve the safety of patients taking this class of medications.
Moreover, to improve patient outcomes, anticoagulation therapy must involve patient education. Patients must obtain anticoagulant education from a medical professional who understands the risks of the medication and how to prevent them (Saptarini, Sujianto, & Nurjazuli, 2021). Warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants are less likely to cause adverse pharmacological events when used as established anticoagulation therapy protocols that involve patient participation. Maintain and convey patient medication information clearly and consistently. There is evidence to suggest that patient’s results can be affected by medication inconsistencies. Reconciliation is a procedure of comparing a patient’s current prescriptions to the new ones that have been prescribed to ensure that there are no differences. The comparison considers the requirement to continue current prescriptions and the potential for duplications, omissions, and interactions. Reconciling pharmaceutical information includes the name of the medicine, dosage, frequency of use, route, and purpose. To ensure the safe prescribing of pharmaceuticals in the future, organizations must identify the data they need to collect and use that data."
"Firstly, retailers are the direct link between consumers and products. They typically operate brick-and-mortar stores or online platforms where customers can purchase goods. Retailers have a deep understanding of consumer demand and market trends, allowing them to curate product assortments that attract potential buyers. Their role extends beyond simply selling products, as they often provide customer service, after-sales support, and brand representation. Retailers facilitate transactions and create a seamless shopping experience, thereby driving sales and revenue for both themselves and the manufacturers they collaborate with.
On the other hand, wholesalers bridge the gap between manufacturers and retailers. They purchase large quantities of products from manufacturers and sell them in smaller quantities to retailers. Wholesalers often serve as intermediaries, leveraging their capacity to buy in bulk to negotiate lower prices and maintain healthy profit margins. They provide a crucial service for manufacturers, as they help distribute products to a wide network of retailers across different regions. The efficiency of wholesalers in streamlining the distribution process contributes to cost savings for manufacturers and ensures that products reach retailers in a timely manner.
Lastly, manufacturers are responsible for designing, producing, and assembling the products that ultimately reach the hands of consumers. They invest heavily in research and development, product design, and manufacturing processes to create goods that align with market demands. Manufacturers must carefully manage their supply chains, including the sourcing of raw materials and components, to ensure product quality and timely production. A manufacturer's success hinges on their ability to meet consumer standards, deliver products on time, and maintain cost-efficiency. Collaborating closely with wholesalers and retailers is crucial to secure market access and sustain ongoing sales.
The financial success or failure of a business heavily relies on the synergy between these stakeholder groups. An efficient and effective supply chain ensures that products are available when and where consumers want them. Retailers and wholesalers contribute to a business's financial success through increased sales, profit margins, and market penetration. By understanding consumer needs and trends, and efficiently distributing products, retailers and wholesalers drive revenue for both themselves and the manufacturers they work with. Conversely, poor collaboration, stockouts, or inefficient distribution can result in missed sales opportunities and increased costs, leading to financial failure.
In conclusion, retailers, wholesalers, and manufacturers are vital stakeholders in the supply chain of product-oriented businesses. Their unique roles and contributions are integral to the financial success or failure of a business. By understanding their differences and collaborating effectively, businesses can optimize their supply chain, meet consumer needs, and achieve long-term financial stability."
"Introduction (100 words)
Statistical knowledge plays a vital role in healthcare administration, providing essential tools for decision-making, resource allocation, quality improvement, and evidence-based practice. This essay aims to explore the significance of statistical knowledge in healthcare administration, highlighting its relevance in healthcare decision-making, identification of trends and patterns, and its impact on patient outcomes. Examples and references will be used to illustrate the practical application of statistical knowledge in healthcare administration.
Importance in Decision-Making (200 words)
The accurate interpretation and utilization of statistical data are pivotal in making informed decisions for effective healthcare administration. Statistical knowledge helps administrators identify patterns, trends, and correlations in patient outcomes, thereby enabling evidence-based decision-making. For instance, by studying the statistical distribution of surgical complications, administrators can make data-driven decisions regarding resource allocation and intervention strategies to enhance patient outcomes and safety.
Additionally, statistical knowledge aids in forecasting and predicting future healthcare needs, ensuring appropriate planning and allocation of resources. For example, by analyzing demographic data, administrators can predict population growth and adjust healthcare facilities and services accordingly, averting potential shortages or oversupply.
Identification of Trends and Patterns (200 words)
Statistical knowledge also enables healthcare administrators to identify trends and patterns in patient data, leading to improved patient care and preventative measures. By analyzing population health data, administrators can identify patterns of disease prevalence, enabling proactive public health campaigns and targeted intervention strategies. For instance, statistical analysis may reveal an increasing rate of chronic conditions, prompting administrators to allocate resources for disease prevention programs or public health initiatives.
Moreover, statistical data helps in tracking and monitoring healthcare outcomes, allowing administrators to identify areas of improvement and optimize the delivery of healthcare services. By analyzing patient satisfaction surveys and healthcare performance metrics, administrators can pinpoint areas requiring intervention, leading to quality improvement initiatives and enhanced patient outcomes.
Impact on Patient Outcomes (200 words)
Statistical knowledge significantly influences patient outcomes in healthcare administration. The utilization of statistical tools, such as risk-adjustment models, aids in evaluating healthcare interventions by accounting for patient characteristics and confounding variables. This analysis provides insights into the effectiveness of different treatment approaches and enables administrators to adopt evidence-based practices that enhance patient outcomes.
Furthermore, statistical knowledge helps identify disparities in healthcare delivery, promoting equity and access. Through analysis of demographic data and healthcare utilization rates, administrators can identify underserved populations and implement targeted interventions to improve access to healthcare services.
The integration of statistical data with electronic health records (EHRs) has revolutionized healthcare administration, enabling personalized patient care and predictive analytics. By utilizing statistical algorithms, administrators can predict individual patient outcomes, identify potential adverse events, and provide tailored interventions, thereby improving overall patient care and reducing healthcare costs.
Conclusion (100 words)
In summary, statistical knowledge holds immense significance in healthcare administration. It empowers administrators to make informed decisions, identify trends, patterns, and disparities, and impact patient outcomes positively. As healthcare becomes increasingly data-driven, statistical knowledge plays a crucial role in promoting evidence-based practice and effective resource allocation. Healthcare administrators must continue to develop their statistical competencies to utilize the full potential of statistical knowledge in improving healthcare delivery and patient outcomes."
"For decades, people’s perception of social equality has been intertwined with the phenomenon of paying no attention to ethnic affiliation. However, instead of embracing the idea of universal equity, this concept resulted in the explicit enablement of white supremacy. For example, celebrating equality in the US essentially meant being generalized and assimilated into the image of a Caucasian white male. Hence, while at some point, society wanted to eliminate discrimination through everyone being “the same underneath,” only ethnic, gender, and sexual minorities were forced to sacrifice their identity. The result of such assimilation is especially vivid in the case of Japanese Americans and their mass assimilation aimed at creating the model minority (Shih et al., 2019). In order to be accepted in the community, minority populations were threatened with embracing another culture as their own.
Such ignorance should never be mistaken for equality of being the same. The power of equality is to allow one to express their cultural identity without the fear of being marginalized in society. Moreover, embracing genuine interest in different cultures is what makes people evolve in their perspective on the world and critical thinking. Years of discrimination have eliminated the history of hundreds of ethnic minorities, so now is the time to make sure that everyone learns and cherishes their ancestors to the same extent. Undeniably, many people dwell on the fact that the idea of multi-culturalism is highly complex, especially in working or educational settings. However, the study of cultural diversity should never focus on creating exclusive communities that have nothing in common. Diversity is about shared learning of one’s values to find common ground with no discrimination against minorities."
"There are numerous US criminal cases that raise the question of trying juvenile offenders in adult courts. Currently, almost in half of the states in the country, juveniles can be prosecuted and tried in adult courts. Pennsylvania is one such state, as there is no lower limit for the age someone can be charged as an adult with homicide. The 2009 case involving a double murder illustrates the numerous issues that take place in all similar cases.
In February 2009, state police found 26-year-old Kenzie Houk, who was eight months pregnant, in her bed with a bullet through her head. Jordan Brown, the son of the victim’s fiancé, is one of the youngest suspects in the country to be charged with murder. According to Heide (2021), juvenile murder arrests in the United States increased dramatically from 1984 to 1993, leading experts to forecast an epidemic of continued violence. Since then, numerous approaches and techniques have been tested to reduce juvenile violence. Nevertheless, they have not provided a highly efficient uniform framework that can assist in mitigating the issue.
A wide range of factors should be taken into account when realizing the reasons for such a severe problem in the country. Moreover, a dedicated analysis is needed to realize the effectiveness of the already existing programs and institutions aimed at reducing the risks of violent crime among juveniles. Furthermore, the issue of recidivism should be widely discussed, as preventing it has always been considered one of the primary goals of the institutions that work with juvenile criminals. A large number of evidence-based practices are to be considered when providing the best solutions that can help develop a uniform approach to the issue in all states."
"“Young Goodman Brown” was written by Nathaniel Hawthorne in 1835, but it was set in Puritan New England during the late 17th century. The Puritans split from England’s Anglican Church, arriving at Plymouth Rock and founding both Plymouth and Boston. They became the main Christian sect in New England at the period, though other Christian groups such as Quakers and Anabaptists also had significant populations. Puritans believed in a rigid philosophy that left no space for mistake; for example, immoral thoughts and dreams were seen to be as damaging as actually committing a sin. Native Americans who did not follow Christianity were likewise thought to be Satan’s children, according to them. “Young Goodman Brown” is set during the Salem Witch Trials in Massachusetts and exposes the Salem Puritans’ hypocritical and inhibitive moral ideals."
"Overview
In this research paper, drug addiction will be analyzed as the only type of personal addiction to facilitate the analysis process and give consistent study-level treatment recommendations. Firstly, many scientists define the term drug addiction differently. On the one hand, the term’ drug addiction is specifically defined by NIDA (1) as “characterized by intense and, at times, uncontrollable drug craving, along with compulsive drug seeking and use that persist even in the face of devastating consequences (2020). On the other hand, Liu and Li (1823) define drug addiction as “a complex disorder that involves complicated neural mechanisms and psychological processes; this mental disorder is treatable and may be curable by therapies such as gene modulation in the future” (2018). As a result, one may observe scientists defining the term from different scientific perspectives by emphasizing some of the facets of drug addiction disease. Statistically, the most prevailed drug usage was observed for cannabis (3,8%) among people from 15 to 64 years old, amphetamines (0,77%), opioids (0,37%), and cocaine (0,35%) (Peacock et al., 1909). Based on this information, it is crucial to admit that drug addiction is a widespread and complex disease that might influence different aspects of individuals’ functioning possibilities.
More specifically, drug dependence is an intellectual disease powerfully affected by surroundings and psychosocial factors. The psychosocial environments at which point it has grown provoke numerous debates around the country (Cheron & Kerchove D’Exaerde, 2021). Exposure to analyzed suggestions can be a principal issue in precipitating drug cravings and relapses. Even afterward a successful cure, they should be minimized accordingly. As with many other mental disorders, drug inclination is deeply influenced by fervor, knowledge, and cognition (Cheron & Kerchove D’Exaerde, 2021). Besides medical interferences, behavioral actions are more promising for acting drug addiction. To some extent, non-pharmacological situations grant permission and have greater benefits by way of their limited aftereffects.
Despite the numerous reasons for obtaining drug addiction after drug abuse, there are no specific factors that can conclude if one will enhance compulsive to rugs. Moreover, a blend of determinants influences risk for inclination (Kumar et al., 2019). Changes in the intelligence that support material and emotional reliance on amazing essences are the direct cause of dependence, but those changes do not happen accidentally. As a result, the individual might have a certain factor of influence that becomes dangerous in case of direct contact. For instance, this might be a close person with strictly negative exposure to the cured individual.
When it comes to the main differences between drug addiction and other addiction types, it is critical to understand that they have nearly the same symptoms and short-term effects on the brain but significantly differ in the long-term perspective. More specifically, Lindesmith (4) states that “While alcohol is addicting in approximately, the same sense that heroin is, it will also be referred to only incidentally” (2017). Consequently, cannabis is unlike heroin or morphine addiction, and alcohol is not covered by anti-narcotic legislation, but it shares many features with opiate addiction.
As a result, drug addiction campaigns might unintentionally be not focused on lowering the rate of addicted people in the US. Instead, the substance-addicted become excluded from society, which creates a distinct class of people that are united by the same situation (Cheron & Kerchove D’Exaerde, 2021). Some theoretical applications also provide evidence that drug addiction is usually supported by overall depression, while in other addiction types, such as alcohol or sexual addiction, individuals activate themselves, which may even have some dangerous consequences (Zou et al., 2017). The whole relocation of recreation affecting the mind so as to produce vivid visions entities from people is the pair impractical and hopeless. There has never in record existed a drug-free association, and it is unlikely that skilled always will be individual. In spite of this reality, law enforcement condemning the unenviable task of completing activity restraining relating to sports drug-use policies that stress frugality.
Another important aspect of drug addiction treatment is the correct medication process. In fact, medication might be considered a regular vaccination since it is focused on giving a small dose of the same drug that causes addiction, but in medically calculated amounts so that the body might adapt to the new regime of this drug consumption. For instance, famous psychologist Freud believed that cocaine would manage to help his friend to escape significant addiction to morphine. This attempt was abandoned, and eventually, von Fleischl-Marxov withered from cocaine addiction (Loose, 2018). However, nowadays, most medical professionals in the US are able to correctly calculate the needed dose for a proper medication so that the possibility of receiving the additional drug addiction is extremely low.
Finally, when it comes to treatment possibilities, drug addiction curing depends on the type and scope of the patient’s problems and needs. Research signifies that most compulsive things need not completely three months of treatment to stop their dependence on the illegal substance considerably and that best choice consequences accompany longer durations of the situation (NIDA, 2020). Recovery from drug cravings is an unending process and repeatedly requires diversified adventures of cases. As with additional incessant sicknesses, relapses to dependence on illegal substances can occur and concede the possibility signal a need for the situation expected to be reinstated or regulated. In fact, treatment changes consistently on the type of drug and the traits of the subjects (NIDA, 2020). Matching situation backgrounds, interventions, and aids to an individual’s particular questions and needs detracts from welcoming or her best benefit in responding to beneficial functioning ancestral, institution, and society.
Recovery Plan
Logistics
In the case of group consultation, all the patients will pass both general and specialized treatment processes depending on their physical and psychological health conditions. As one of the main psychological remedies, a group would exercise behavioral therapies that would be prescribed during the first consultation. In fact, treatments with a behavioral focus may address a patient’s motivation to change, provide encouragement for abstinence, enhance skills to resist drug abuse, replace drug-using activities with more constructive and rewarding activities, and improve interpersonal relationships (NIDA, 2020). Nevertheless, patients should primarily receive a medical treatment plan. More specifically, they will receive an individualized list of special drugs that would help to cure the addiction effects. Gradually, combined with constant help from consultants, patients will disclose the opportunity for psychologists to cure the addiction from a mental health perspective entirely. Some mental diseases might be interconnected with drug addiction. Consequently, medical professionals should be vigilant with patient interaction dynamics and psychological exposure to the treatment process. Finally, participating in peer support programs during and after treatment can assist in maintaining abstinence.
When it comes to the individual consulting process, the patient should have a determined medical professional who has a specialization in drug addiction treatment. Primarily, the patient would attend nearly three general consultations where a medical professional would define the key characteristics of actual addiction (Grenfell & Hart, 2018). After that, a person would certainly follow a prescribed medical course to cure substance addiction physically. Simultaneously, the patient should receive regular medication sessions. More specifically, medications are the main aspect of treatment for many cases, particularly when combined with accompanying advising and different behavioral healings. For example, methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone (containing a new long-acting expression) are effective in meal things addicted to dope or added opioids maintain their lives and reduce their illegal dependence on a banned substance (NIDA, 2020). Acamprosate, disulfiram, and naltrexone are drugs approved for curing alcohol abuse. For persons compulsive to nicotine, a nicotine substitute output or oral pill is.
Since drug addiction and abuse are considered mental disorders, and they coexist with different mental diseases, many patients who represent multi-disease should be correctly evaluated for the existence of parallel issues. Finally, the patients should be advised at the end of the course, which is the most significant part of the treatment process since it defines its efficiency. During this consultation, the patient will determine their level of health. In case of normalization, the patient will be prescribed regular drugs that would help to maintain the level of independence. The client will also be consulted at the interval of three days. If needed, the gap might be modified in accordance with the patient’s health conditions.
Treatment Plan
In the case of the basic scenario execution, the drug-addicted patient would pass a 70-day general course of treatment which might be divided into three main stages. The general course contains three main sessions at the beginning of each stage and at least seven supportive sessions that last more than 30 minutes. Firstly, the debut week will be dedicated to actively consulting with the patient and defining the safest and most individualized recovery plan. Secondly, the patient will pass a dynamic 40-day physical and mental treatment process, which includes taking medically prescribed drugs and visiting a professional psychotherapist. After that, the final stage of the treatment would emphasize the development of the patient’s consistent life routine and provide additional consultations with the medical professional, individually attached to the person. In the case of group treatment, patients might experience additional collaboration sessions where all the engaged course members exchange their opinion about the current treatment. These sessions should be added, not interchanged with the general number of sessions.
Issues in Treatment
There are many possible issues during the treatment course, but there is a necessity to analyze only the most probable and significant of them. Firstly, the patient might not be motivated to quit their addiction. Lack of life objectives or family rejection might be the most significant influencers to continue drug addiction. Secondly, the patient could experience negative external influences, so additional psychological issues might become acute. As it was stated before, drug addiction usually coexists with some psychological issues, so it is critical to timely identify the development of mental issues. For instance, a patient might continue abusive interconnections with their siblings that demotivate the individual’s treatment. In this case, the medical professional should immediately provide determined consultation where the patient would decide to limit the dangerous exposure. Last but not least, the patient might be internally disappointed with the course result, in particular, at the middle stage of the treatment. As a result, the individual consultant should consistently dedicate some time to checking the stability of the patient’s mental and physical health. More specifically, it is highly recommended to have regular meetings nearly four times a day before eating. In this case, the patient would be motivated to describe all the issues in a specific manner so that the medical professional would have a better understanding of the problem."
"Firstly, strategic planning serves as the foundation for effective management. By defining the organization's mission, vision, and goals, it sets the stage for aligning all activities and resources towards a common purpose. Without a well-defined strategy, managers may find themselves making decisions in a reactive manner, lacking a clear understanding of the bigger picture. Strategic planning enables managers to focus their efforts on achieving specific objectives, promotes unity within the organization, and ensures that resources are used efficiently and effectively.
Moreover, strategic planning allows managers to anticipate and adapt to changes in the business environment. By conducting a thorough analysis of both external factors (such as market trends, competition, and regulatory changes) and internal factors (such as strengths, weaknesses, and capabilities), organizations gain a better understanding of their current position and future prospects. This allows managers to identify potential threats and opportunities, helping them make informed decisions and allocate resources strategically. Without such planning, an organization may become stagnant, unable to respond swiftly to competitive pressures or seize new market opportunities.
However, misconceptions often arise when it comes to strategic planning. One common misconception is that strategic planning is a one-time event. In reality, strategic planning is an ongoing process that requires continuous evaluation and adjustment. The business environment is dynamic, constantly evolving, and organizations need to adapt their strategies accordingly. Effective strategic planning involves regularly reviewing and updating the strategy to reflect changes and new insights, ensuring that the organization remains agile and responsive to emerging challenges and opportunities.
Another misconception is that strategic planning is solely the responsibility of top management. While it is true that leaders play a crucial role in the strategic planning process, it is essential to involve employees at all levels. Engaging the workforce in strategic planning fosters a sense of ownership and commitment, encouraging them to align their efforts with the organization's objectives. Furthermore, employees often possess valuable insights and perspectives that leaders may overlook, contributing to richer and more robust strategic plans.
In conclusion, strategic planning is of paramount importance in managerial activities, providing direction, focus, and flexibility in a constantly evolving business landscape. The misconceptions associated with it, such as perceiving it as a one-time event or solely the responsibility of top management, can hinder its effectiveness. To fully leverage the benefits of strategic planning, organizations must recognize its ongoing nature and involve employees at all levels. By doing so, organizations can navigate uncertainty, capitalize on opportunities, and effectively achieve their long-term goals."
"Bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, can be debilitating conditions that significantly impact an individual's quality of life. Diagnostic tests and treatment approaches for these diseases have evolved over the years, aiming to identify and manage symptoms effectively. Additionally, dieticians play a crucial role in the comprehensive management of bowel diseases by providing tailored nutrition plans and guidance. In this essay, I will discuss the various diagnostic tests and treatment approaches for bowel diseases, emphasizing the vital contribution of dieticians in managing symptoms.
To diagnose bowel diseases, physicians employ a combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, imaging techniques, and endoscopic procedures. Medical history, physical examination, and the patient's symptoms guide the initial assessment. Laboratory tests, including blood tests and stool samples, can help identify inflammation markers and determine the presence of infectious agents. Imaging techniques like X-rays, computerized tomography (CT) scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enable clinicians to evaluate the condition of the bowel, detect structural abnormalities, and assess the severity of disease. Endoscopic procedures, such as colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy, involve the insertion of a flexible tube with a camera into the bowel to visually examine the lining and collect tissue samples for further analysis. These diagnostic tests are essential in confirming the presence of bowel diseases and distinguishing between different conditions to tailor the treatment approach accordingly.
Once diagnosed, the treatment of bowel diseases aims to manage symptoms, induce remission, and prevent relapses. Treatment approaches typically involve the use of medication, lifestyle modifications, and, in some cases, surgical interventions. Medications such as anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressants, and biologic agents can help reduce inflammation, control the immune response, and alleviate symptoms. Lifestyle modifications, including stress reduction techniques, regular exercise, and smoking cessation, are crucial for managing symptoms and improving overall well-being. In cases where medications and lifestyle changes are insufficient, surgical interventions may be necessary to remove diseased portions of the bowel or create temporary or permanent ostomies.
Amidst these treatment approaches, diet plays a significant role in managing bowel diseases. Dieticians are key members of the healthcare team involved in developing individualized nutrition plans for patients with bowel diseases. They work closely with patients to identify trigger foods that exacerbate symptoms and recommend appropriate dietary modifications. Specific diets, such as the low-FODMAP diet, have shown promising results in reducing bowel symptoms by minimizing the intake of fermentable carbohydrates that can worsen symptoms in some individuals. Dieticians also provide guidance on ensuring adequate nutrient intake, as bowel diseases can lead to malabsorption and nutrient deficiencies. Moreover, they educate patients about the importance of maintaining a healthy weight and managing stress, as these factors can impact symptom severity.
In conclusion, bowel diseases pose significant challenges for individuals affected by them. However, through various diagnostic tests and treatment approaches, including medication, lifestyle modifications, and surgery, symptom management and remission can be achieved. Additionally, dieticians play a crucial role in the management of bowel diseases by providing tailored nutrition plans and guidance. By collaborating with healthcare teams, they assist in minimizing symptoms, preventing relapses, and enhancing overall well-being for patients with bowel diseases."
"Archetypes describe such characteristics, which are universal patterns that define certain events, objects, or people. In literature, they describe representations and concepts that are common to all people, which allow people to understand and interpret stories. However, archetypes also exist in everyday life and play a significant role in shaping the perception of the world around them. In particular, there are archetypes of people that help determine their character and actions, as well as motivation.
Applying this concept to everyday life, one can single out special types of people who have a set of common and exclusive characteristics for them. They are formed both on the basis of the actions and inclinations of the person and depending on the environment. An example of an archetype in everyday life is the head of a large modern corporation, such as Elon Musk. He can be defined as a hero or creator who has the inspiration and courage to change the world around him. Other people perceive it in this way, which makes it a great example of an archetype. All his actions are motivated precisely by these characteristics, and his primary motivation is the transformation of the world.
The presence of archetypes in everyday life allows me to compose a more comprehensive perception of people and events. In particular, based on the characteristics I know, I can determine the motivation and role of a certain person, which makes him more predictable. This is certainly more difficult than may be presented in the literature because people often have mixed features. However, in general, the concept of archetypes gives me the opportunity to understand the actions of people and their characters. I can later use this information to form my own relationship with them."

"Introduction
Milk preservation is a key concern to large-scale dairy farmers across the globe. The product is required to remain fresh from the source to the consumer. This has led to the development of milk devices that aid farmers and dairy factories to process and preserve the product. Factors such as presence of pathogens in the milk products, lowers the duration the commodities take while still fresh and fit for consumption (Garcia et al., 2019). The condition for the equipment has to be maintained cleaned to ensure the products do not get spoiled or become unfit for human consumption. Furthermore, some of the equipment help milk processors to make various types of milk products like cheese, cream, butter, and so on. With the use of the devices in the production, individuals have been able to lower the costs involved, like labor, and reduce the time consumption during packaging. The focus of his paper is to analyze milky devices and the current technological involvement.
Background
Dairy plants have evolved to use equipment that facilitates processes like milk manufacturing, pasteurizing, packaging, storing, and transportation. Initially, these activities were expensive, time-consuming when the level of technology was limited (Charlton & Kostandini, 2021). Currently, the advancement in engineering has made the processes convenient due introduction of various machines that perform the factions effectively. Most dairy farms have access to equipment like tanks for storing milk, cream churner milk containers, tubular heat exchangers, and evaporation systems that aid in the processes. The machines are useful in ensuring farmers do not incur unnecessary losses resulting from poor preservation. They have improved dairy farming since the plants can manage to process the amount of milk produced.
Technology for Dairy products back in the 1900s
There has been an improvement in dairy products over the past century. The milk processing industry has been growing gradually to provide dairy foods that meet the expectations of human diets with respect to nutrients, safety, and overall sustainability. Around 1917, the private dairy farmers presented milk products to their consumers in their locations (Rankin et al., 2017). During this time, farmers had started adopting pasteurization as the mechanism of preserving and controlling milk from contamination by some diseases.
In the milk processing plant, the mechanization of cream separation, filling, washing bottles, and capping them set the root of modern industrialization in the sector. Between the years 1907 and 1913, bottle machines were put into use as well as the fillers and cappers (Capstaff & Miller, 2018). To enhance the safety and increase sanitation of the milk products, there were some advancement made on the mechanical bottle washers. Most countries developed compulsory pasteurization processes due to diseases that were connected to unsafe milk consumption that caused deaths amongst adults and children.
The process of milk pasteurization was officially in use but the methods, timing, and temperatures totally varied from farm to farm. There were no heat regulators during this period therefore the process took about 60 seconds at a temperature of about 72 degrees Celsius followed by immediate cooling. Similarly, proper timing was not manageable due to a lack of technology (Charlton & Kostandini, 2021). It was termed flash pasteurization and it was not fully accepted due to its limitation. Another current technology involved in dairy industry is using the in-bottled method. In this process, the bottled milk was subjected to a high temperature of about 63 degrees Celsius for close to 30 minutes. It proved effective because it reduced the shortfalls of post-pasteurization.
The advancement in technology prompted the improvement in dairy products as effective equipment was developed. Devices like a vat holder, heater, and cooler were used to improve the milk pasteurization process. Another milestone in the dairy plant was achieved in 1934 when a mechanical refrigerator was introduced to help in preserving the products. On the basis of sanitation, the use of stainless steel bulk ensured the commodities were kept safe.
Current Technology
Scientists and technologists have been working to improve the milk processing procedure and the content of the products. Over the last decade, a number of innovations and advancement in technology has been made to enhance productivity in the industry. Some of the current know-how used is aimed at lowering cost, increasing shelf life, and separating the component products of milk (Akbar et al., 2020). Some of the current technologies used in the milk processing plant are discussed below.
Milk Analyser
Fluid milk consists of various components like lactose, fat, protein, total solids, and other elements. The milk processing plants use the Mid-infrared examination method to determine the composition of the product (Akbar et al., 2020). Once the analysis has been done, the result is used to evaluate the amount of money the dairy farmer will receive in relation to the available contents. Mid Infrared Spectroscopy also helps farmers to decide on what feeds to give their animals to influence the needed components. The technology is fast and facilitates efficiency in the testing of milk components.
Automated Sprayer Dryer
Dairy farmers are able to undertake the necessary quality tests using the automated sprayer dyer at once. During the analysis process, a sample of the milk products is taken and analyzed by infrared technology to determine the content of moisture in the milk powder, bulk, and temperature (Shinde et al., 2018). There is a specific inline powder developed for the automated sprayer dryer. The procedure is helpful since it allows the producers to set warning alarms in case of product loss during the manufacturing process.
Automated Clean-In-Place (CIP) System
This system allows the milk plants to clean the interior surfaces of the pipes, filters, vessels, associated fittings, and process equipment while they are intact. CIP uses sensors, controllers, valves that are well-programmed to enhance effectiveness. It makes the plant maintain the required level of hygiene for the proper preservation of the milk products (Ledo et al., 2020). Internal cleaning is essential as the materials get into contact with the milk.
Direct Vat Set (DVS) Cultures
Currently, milk processing industries are using some species of microorganisms to facilitate the production of fermented products. DVS are significant since they have no side effects to the consumers and they also improve the immune system (Rankin et al., 2017). The main reason for applying the DVS cultures in the milk processing steps is to increase the production at a relatively lower time. For instance, it takes about 10 hours to make a curd using a homemade approach whereas when the microorganisms are used, the production time is halved.
High-Performance Liquid Chromatography
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is a reliable, precise accurate process that helps in detecting the presence of melamine in pasteurized milk, ultra-heat temperatures, soft cheese, milk powder, and powdered infant formula (Ledo et al., 2020). Generally, melamine is an organic chemical compound that looks like a white crystal. HPLC enables farmers to easily locate the melamine hence reducing the time that would have been taken in the process.
Fortification of Milk
In most cases, the component of milk does not contain all the required nutrients. To ensure consumers obtain the necessary minerals, some vitamins that are not contained in the milk products are added (Ledo et al. 2020). Fortified milk is essential for human consumption because it has a good ratio of useful ailments. The process is essential in increasing the mineral and vitamin content suitable for human consumption.
Ultra-High Temperature (UHT)
UHT is used to aid in the process of the pasteurization of milk in the industry. It involves using commercially sterilized equipment to heat milk then fill them under an aseptic state into packages that are hermetically sealed (Warncke & Kulozik, 2020). During this process, milk is heated for about two seconds at a temperature of 138 degrees Celsius then cooled down quickly. UHT is capable of eliminating bacteria present in the product, therefore, increasing the shelf life of milk. After UHT, the commodity can take a long like six months without refrigeration.
High-Temperature Short Time (HTST)
The dairy plant uses hot water and metal plates to attain the required temperature suitable for pasteurization. HTST technique also allows dairy farmers to heat under a temperature of about 71 degrees Celsius within a time frame of 15 seconds (Garcia et al., 2019). It is then cooled off before packaging to enhance the shelf life. It also enables the dairy farmers to eliminate the threat of bacteria present in milk products.
Dairy Product Composition and Attribute Testing
Currently, near-infrared and inline mid-infrared technology is being used in the firms to enable the manufacturers to establish and analyze the composition of the products. The system makes it easier to test the components of the liquid milk (Akbar et al., 2020). The factories usually produce a large quantity of milk therefore the advancement makes it easier to examine the milk for cheese making and other products.
Types of Equipment for Dairy and Milk
Dairy Pasteurizers
This equipment is used to heat the dairy products to a considerable temperature that is suitable for killing the pathogens that might be present in the milk. They are used to enhance and increase the safety of milk for human consumption.
Dairy Milk Tanks
In the dairy plant, there are tanks used for storing milk, cooling, and for fermentation. There are isolated tanks, one-lay, two-lay, and process tanks that are used in the processing process.
Homogenizer
This machine helps in making the milk products have a uniform consistency to minimize separation. It also helps in reducing large fat globules into tiny ones (Warncke & Kulozik, 2020). The equipment facilitates the conversion of two insoluble liquids to form an emulsion. It enhances flexibility and quality performance in the industry during the processing. Furthermore, it reduces the intensity of work done in processing milk.
Dairy Separator
This equipment is used by dairy farmers or milk processing plants to separate skimmed milk and cream. They increase the effectiveness in the processing of milk and enables farmers to reduce cost. Dairy separators are easy to use therefore very efficient for most milk plants. The machine makes it easier for the dairy farmers to lower labor and have different composition of the milk products.
Manufacturing of Milk (How it is Manufactured, Pasteurized)
The process of manufacturing milk involves a series of steps. It starts with milking cows by attaching vacuum cups to their teats. After that, the liquid milk is taken to refrigerated vats for storage under a temperature condition of about 5 Degrees Celsius. Milk is then transported to factory tankers where different procedures take place, such as pasteurization where milk is put at an extreme temperature of 72 Degrees Celsius for about 15 seconds to destroying harmful pathogens. The process allows the products to have an extended shelf life. The next step is homogenization, this method subject milk to high pressure that helps to disperse fat globules (Soundous et al., 2019). It enables manufacturers to stop the cream from rising to the top and separating to ensure a consistent taste and texture of the product.
The milk is then taken to centrifugal separation to enable the removal of the available cream to facilitate the making of low-fat or skim milk. The other procedure is ultrafiltration which involves passing milk across a given membrane at a considerable pressure to aid in holding back the fat globules and other proteins present in the milk content (Mikhaylin et al., 2018). During this process, lactose and water pass through the membrane leaving behind the large particles including calcium complexes.
The next process involves reverse osmosis which is more like ultrafiltration only that the membrane permits water to pass across leaving lactose. Then there is ultra-osmosis that entails both reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration (Mikhaylin et al., 2018). This procedure allows salt and water to go through holding back solid milk. Another procedure is spray drying which helps to eliminate water from milk to produce powdered milk products. The process does not interfere with the nutrition content of the milk. The last step is permeating, which enables the manufacturers to produce milk having consistent properties.
Future Research
Based on the predicted demand for milk products in the future, agriculturalists should further the research on how to increase the amount of milk each cow can produce. The finding should focus on ways of raising the limit without having a devastating effect on the life of an animal (Capstaff & Miller, 2018). If such improvement can be achieved, sustainability shall also go up since it will not be necessary for the farmer to keep a large number of dairy animals.
The world population is projected to increase; therefore, the need to produce more milk products will increase as well. Researchers and agriculturalists should do some studies on how the different combinations of feeds would improve the quality of milk products to minimize industrial processes that complicate the process (Capstaff & Miller, 2018). With the expected pressure in consumption, they should search for ways of modernization to reduce the labor cost associated.
Furthermore, with the intense need for organic food products in market, research should be done on the milk industry to find possible ways by which organic milk products suitable for human consumption can be produced. Similarly, the shelf life of the commodities should be enhanced to ensure they can stay for more than a year without spoilage (Charlton & Kostandini, 2021). Moreover, temperature fluctuation is a common threat on the shelf-stable, the scientist should invest and research on technology that involves using mobile apps to control temperature.
Conclusion
In summary, the dairy industry has experienced a great magnitude of improvement in relation to past practices. The need to maintain safety and shelf-life stability has made scientists formulate good and effective machines and technologies viable in the sector. There has been a constant rise in the need for milk and other dairy products, which has made farmers to actively involved using the modern equipment to sustain the supply. Technology has made it easier for dairy farmers to handle a large volume of milk at a time. Through the pasteurization process, it has been efficient to keep pasteurized milk for a long period of time, therefore, minimizing possible losses.
Furthermore, the determination of milk composition has enabled supplies to earn more income depending on the content. Similarly, the safety of consumers has also been improved since most of the pathogens are removed through UHT. According to the development in technology, including the internet of things, researchers can determine better ways to minimize the production cost, quality and quantity to be produced in the future."
"Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have become a part of all humans’ lives, but they remain a debatable issue thus far. Some people argue that it is not ethical to change any genetic information and play God (MacKinnon & Fiala, 2017). However, I believe that GMOs are only another advancement in people’s lives as the creation of machines, cars, or spaceships. GMOs (be it a plant or animal) are a part of my life as well, as I have consumed GMO-based products. I am not concerned about long-term effects as much as some of my peers since I find GMOs to be a product of selection that has been in place for centuries. People have noticed some properties they considered to be appropriate for them and tried to grow as many plants and animals that have certain qualities as possible.
I would use the principles of utilitarianism to support my claim. This theory is based on the view that everything is ethical if it contributes to as much good for as many people as possible. GMOs can help people overcome one of the major problems that is famine. GMOs are resistant to harsh environmental conditions, so people may grow more crops and other important plants. Millions of people still starve and are in need of food, so the production of more food is beneficial for all. Of course, some use the deontological approach and state that it is simply wrong to interfere with genetic codes as it is the divine domain. GMOs are seen as people’s attempts to play God, which is morally wrong. However, I would stress that even according to the Bible, humans were given the planet to take care of it, so using innovative tools is another way to follow the Christian postulates and take care of all creatures."

"The World Summit on Information Society (WSIS) and civil society organizations have the potential to play a crucial role in addressing socioeconomic inequities in post-colonial communities. These organizations can leverage technology and information to empower marginalized populations and bridge the digital divide, ultimately leading to more inclusive and sustainable development.
To begin with, the WSIS can facilitate knowledge sharing and capacity building by promoting inclusive policies and strategies. Through its platforms, it can provide a space for governments, civil society, and other stakeholders to discuss and implement initiatives that promote equitable access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) in post-colonial communities. By fostering collaboration and partnerships, the WSIS can support the creation of infrastructure, build digital skills, and enhance access to information. This, in turn, can empower local communities to address socioeconomic inequities and realize their developmental goals.
Civil society organizations can complement the efforts of the WSIS by acting as advocates and driving grassroots initiatives. These organizations often have a deep understanding of the social, cultural, and economic nuances of post-colonial communities. They can work closely with local governments, communities, and international bodies to ensure that the needs and aspirations of marginalized populations are met. By actively involving these communities in decision-making processes, civil society organizations can help shape policies and projects that effectively address socioeconomic inequities.
However, to ensure ethical and diverse actions, practical control tools must be implemented. Firstly, transparency and accountability mechanisms should be put in place to monitor the actions and impact of both the WSIS and civil society organizations. Regular reporting and evaluation can help identify any biases or shortcomings and ensure inclusivity in the decision-making process.
Additionally, the promotion of diversity and inclusivity within the organizations themselves is crucial. This can be achieved by adopting policies that ensure representation and participation from diverse backgrounds and marginalized communities. By encouraging the inclusion of underrepresented groups, a wider range of perspectives can be considered, leading to more ethical and effective initiatives.
In conclusion, the WSIS and civil society organizations have the potential to address socioeconomic inequities in post-colonial communities. By leveraging technology, promoting inclusive policies, and fostering grassroots initiatives, these entities can help bridge the digital divide and empower marginalized populations. To ensure ethical and diverse actions, transparency, accountability, and inclusivity must be prioritized through practical control tools. Ultimately, these efforts can contribute to a more equitable and sustainable post-colonial society."
"Introduction:
Nursing is an inherently demanding profession that often exposes healthcare professionals to high levels of stress and potentially burnout. However, the concept of learned optimism offers a valuable coping mechanism that can help nurses effectively manage stress levels and improve their emotional well-being. This essay will discuss the ways in which learned optimism serves as a coping mechanism for nurses in the healthcare setting, highlighting its impact on reducing the risk of workplace burnout and improving their overall emotional well-being.
Body:
1. Defining Learned Optimism in Nursing:
Learned optimism, a concept popularized by Martin Seligman, refers to the ability to develop a positive outlook by challenging negative thoughts and beliefs. Nurses who embrace learned optimism can reframe stressors, setbacks, and challenges as temporary and controllable, allowing them to approach difficult situations with resilience and a focus on solutions rather than feeling overwhelmed.
2. Enhancing Coping Mechanisms:
Learned optimism equips nurses with enhanced coping mechanisms to navigate the unique stressors of their profession. By adopting a growth mindset, nurses become more adaptable in managing unexpected situations, such as critical patient conditions or demanding workloads. This perspective allows them to view challenges as opportunities for growth and learning, minimizing the negative impact of stress.
3. Building Resilience and Mental Toughness:
In the healthcare setting, learned optimism plays a crucial role in developing resilience and mental toughness, essential attributes for managing stress levels effectively. By cultivating an optimistic outlook, nurses can bounce back from setbacks, adapt to unpredictable circumstances, and persistently engage in patient care, even in the face of adversity. This resilience serves as a buffer against burnout, facilitating emotional well-being and preventing long-term negative consequences of stress.
4. Shifting Focus to Strengths and Growth:
An optimistic mindset helps nurses shift their focus from dwelling on perceived limitations or failures to identifying and utilizing their strengths. By acknowledging achievements and personal growth, nurses are more likely to experience feelings of self-efficacy and job satisfaction. This shift in perspective decreases the risk of burnout by instilling a sense of purpose and accomplishment, ultimately improving the emotional well-being of nurses.
5. Developing Positive Interpersonal Relationships:
Learned optimism also positively influences nurses' relationships with patients, colleagues, and team members. Optimistic nurses tend to display empathetic and compassionate behaviors, fostering therapeutic relationships with patients based on trust and understanding. Furthermore, they actively seek support from colleagues and contribute positively to team dynamics, creating a supportive work environment that promotes emotional well-being.
6. Increasing Self-care Practices:
Optimistic nurses recognize the importance of self-care as a means to maintain their emotional well-being and prevent burnout. They engage in proactive self-care activities such as exercise, mindfulness, and maintaining a healthy work-life balance. By prioritizing their own needs, nurses can recharge and replenish their energy, reducing the risk of workplace burnout and ensuring their long-term emotional resilience.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, the application of learned optimism significantly contributes to nurses' ability to cope with stress, reducing the risk of workplace burnout, and ultimately improving their emotional well-being. By cultivating an optimistic mindset, nurses are better equipped to face the challenges inherent in the healthcare setting, demonstrating resilience, and embracing growth opportunities. Organizations should emphasize the nurturing of learned optimism through training and support systems, fostering a positive work environment that not only enhances nurses' well-being but also translates into improved patient care outcomes."

"Social media has revolutionized the way we communicate and interact with others. With the advent of various social media platforms, users have been provided with countless avenues to engage and connect with individuals across the globe. These platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat, have undoubtedly had a profound impact on the way users interact with one another. In this essay, we will explore the ways in which the use of different social media platforms has influenced user interaction.
Firstly, social media has facilitated the formation of virtual communities where like-minded individuals can connect and share common interests with ease. For instance, platforms such as Reddit allow users to join different subreddits based on their interests, ranging from art and technology to sports and politics. This hyper-targeted environment fosters engagement among individuals who may have otherwise never met in real life. Consequently, users are exposed to diverse perspectives and are able to engage in thoughtful discussions, expanding their worldview.
Furthermore, social media platforms have provided individuals a platform to express their opinions and share their experiences on a much larger scale. Twitter, for instance, allows users to voice their thoughts in 280 characters, reaching a wide audience instantaneously. This has given rise to online activism and discussions around social justice issues. Users can now mobilize and organize movements, such as #BlackLivesMatter or #MeToo, through social media platforms. While this has amplified marginalized voices and brought awareness to important issues, it has also led to the spread of misinformation and enabled online harassment.
Another impact of social media platforms on user interaction is the nurturing of personal branding. Platforms like Facebook and Instagram allow users to curate their online presence, showcasing their best moments and creating an idealized version of themselves. This tendency to present a highlight reel of one's life can lead to feelings of inadequacy and social comparison among users. Additionally, the constant exposure to carefully crafted profiles may hinder the development of authentic relationships, as individuals may feel pressure to maintain a certain image online.
Lastly, the use of social media platforms promotes a sense of interconnectedness among users. Features like commenting, liking, and sharing content allow users to actively engage with others' posts. This virtually instant feedback and validation can boost self-esteem or foster a sense of belonging. However, it also fosters a culture of seeking external validation and may hinder face-to-face interactions if individuals become overly reliant on feedback through social media.
In conclusion, the use of different social media platforms has greatly influenced user interaction. These platforms have facilitated the formation of virtual communities, increased the reach of individuals' opinions and experiences, nurtured personal branding, and enhanced the sense of interconnectedness. While these impacts have been predominantly positive, some negative consequences such as the spread of misinformation and social comparison have also emerged. It is essential for users to be mindful of the potential pitfalls of social media and to strike a balance between virtual and real-life interactions."

Application
Social Norms
The above field log describes the ordinary day of the female who has a family, a job, hobbies, and educational goals, from which career ambitions emerge. Therefore, I seek to allocate my resources in a way that would allow for the maximally appropriate integration of all of those, which presupposes activity in several spheres in parallel. The latter nuance, in turn, adds to the significance of the role social norms play in my life since the amount as well as a variety of my social contacts increases inevitably.
Thus, during a walk, social norms involve neatness, and proper behavior that does not cause any inconvenience for the surrounding people and other. Furthermore, helping friends is actually possible to see as a norm; those who refuse to do that are considered deviant automatically, regardless of the reason. While shopping, the essential norm-based requirement is to wait in line without trying to avoid that, for instance, by force; regarding online communication, no forms of hate speech and no fakes are socially acceptable. Even domestic life rests partly on social norms, such as cleanness and fresh breath, which hygiene procedures like brushing the teeth target.
Macro-Level and Micro-Level Analysis
It is quite apparent that norms influence both the lives of particular individuals and the performance of the entire society, as the latter actually consists of the former. A norm exists in case the community members practice certain behavior, believing that others do that as well or expecting a compliment from those whose opinion is important to them (UNICEF, 2021). Therefore, at the macro level, social norms make the vast majority of the population act similarly in specific situations and contexts. Hence, unwritten but commonly known and strongly prescribed patterns appear that eventually become integral to the culture. The micro level, meanwhile, stands for the need of a certain individual to adjust his or her everyday behavior to those recommendations so that society recognizes him or her as normal.
Concept Analysis
As the day the field log describes is quite busy, various concepts are applicable to it. One of the main among them is socialization , which is important for both individuals and society, particularly in the context of norms. Thus, Ward et al. (2019) highlight that communication not only simplifies transmitting the rules and principles of a certain community to the next generations but also enables people to put themselves into perspective. In other words, a person acquires a chance to see how the other perceives him or her; this, in turn, determines the areas where corrections are necessary if such exist.
The concept of family , whose essential role is apparent from the log, comprises two subconcepts in the given case, notably, nuclear and extended . The former is worth mentioning among the key determinants of the routine due to the need to coordinate all of the everyday actions with the partner’s lifestyle, day regimen, and demands. The extended family, meanwhile, connects the micro group, whose nuclear equivalent is, to the society, an essential agent of socialization. It is noteworthy that families may have inner traditions, such as usual communication styles; however, those should not prevail over social norms in extrafamilial contexts. If they do, the probability that society will accept the person depends inversely on the degree of the contradiction.
Interactions and impression management are also essential points, which, in fact, are closely intertwined since public opinion on an individual determines his or her social success. In sociological terms, this fact makes people develop so-called images that reflect the ways they would like others to see them (Grebelsky‐Lichtman et al., 2020). Simply stated, the need to interact with society makes its members highlight their strengths and camouflage their weaknesses to reach a higher degree of acceptance. In my case, I monitor the stylishness of my clothes and do not inform my extended family on certain issues I am facing to make my image more favorable.
Reflection
As apparent from the analysis of my everyday life, I interact with society via a range of channels in parallel, playing several roles. Thus, within my nuclear family, I am a spouse, while the members of the extended position me as their child, grandchild, cousin, and other. The ways I interact with each circle, consequently, are dissimilar as well, primarily due to the difference between my feelings in these cases. Notably, my husband perceives me as an adult, helping me realize my responsibility and make important decisions. In the opinion of my parents as well as more distant relatives, on the contrary, I am still too young to be self-sufficient, which can be quite disappointing and, furthermore, affects my self-esteem.
Outside the family, my roles change depending on the context, but their common peculiarity, excluding interactions with friends, is that hardly anybody considers me unique, while my relatives do. Notably, I am one of the numerous walkers in the street and the only other buyer for shop staff; even in social networks, I perform identically to millions of other users. The interaction, therefore, occurs differently as well; my motives in such situations are practical rather than attachment-based. This means that the purpose of such communication comes down to completing tasks or resolving issues, unlike family scenes, where I derive pleasure from contacting dear people.
Notwithstanding the dissimilar nature of the cases, both can show how the other affects me and I affect them. The former manifests itself in the desire to make a maximally positive impression, which, for instance, encourages me to dress decently prior to leaving my home or disguise my problems and failures from my relatives. Regarding the inverse direction, my needs and opinions of mine, both as a close person and as a customer, may be essential, which may make others consider those when shaping their behavior."
"The case under consideration, Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S., was significant for developing measures to avoid discrimination in the workplace. More specifically, it was primarily related to diversity in terms of sex and age since this combination frequently evokes the concerns of the population (King, 2021). The examination of the issue by relying on the example of Gerald Bostock was advantageous for establishing proper employment practices in this respect.
In this lawsuit filed by the plaintiff, the main factor was his unjustified dismissal from the company in which he had otherwise positive reputation. This event was caused by the man’s interest in a gay softball league which he expressed while being in the workplace while neglecting the provisions of Title VII (Mallory et al., 2020). This part of the Civil Rights Act, confirming the violation, was relied on by Bostock when initiating legal action, but it was initially dismissed by the district court due to its allegedly erroneous interpretation (“Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S.,” 2019). The appeal, including the claim to include sexual discrimination in consideration, was successful as Bostock managed to support his position with the opposing statements of Massachusetts law, Chapter 151B (“Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S.,” 2019). In this way, the meaning of the previously used provisions regulating such cases was modified accordingly.
To summarize, the examined court case based on employment law and, more specifically, discrimination against workers happened to be crucial for making adjustments. The previous evidence, as per Title VII of the Civil Rights Act did not include the particular considerations of sex and age. Hence, this gap was compensated for by this decision, and the consequent change in the legal provisions helped guarantee the equality of people in the workplace in the context of their diversity."
"In the present day, cryptocurrency attracts more and more attention of people all over the world. Regardless of not being widespread yet among community members, cryptocurrency is used by a considerable number of financial institutions and companies for its potential to influence the financial market in the future. In general, it may be defined as a virtual of digital currency secured by cryptography – that is why it cannot be double-spent or counterfeited. There are currently several cryptocurrencies, and the majority of them are decentralized networks on the basis of blockchain technologies enforced by computer networks. Cryptocurrency cannot be affected by government manipulation or interference as it is not issued by it or any central authority.
The significance of this study is determined by an unknown and controversial effect of cryptocurrency. While it is frequently regarded as a more convenient and stable alternative to traditional money, some experts state that the instability of cryptocurrency will have a devastating impact on many industries in the future (Nova, 2021). That is why the investigation and evaluation of its potential influence will be beneficial for the development of accurate strategies and preventative measures. The purpose of this paper is to examine the nature of cryptocurrency, its characteristics, and impact on the basis of literature review to answer the research question: Is cryptocurrency unstable? The answer will help to approve or reject a hypothesis that lies in the paper’s thesis statement – being a long-lasting uncontrolled bubble, cryptocurrency contributes to financial and monetary instability, a lack of investor protection, the global market’s downfall, and wealth inequity.
According to previous research, a digital currency may be regarded as a highly convenient alternative to traditional money protected from government regulation. It cannot be double-spent or counterfeited, and its use is frequently defined as a future of the financial market. However, this study that incorporates available data related to cryptocurrency demonstrate its instability that may have highly negative consequences for different industries. According to modern studies, cryptocurrency is a long-lasting bubble which value is artificially created. Without proper control, the fluctuations of is value may lead to serious challenges in the financial market and lead to wealth inequities. In the future, more thorough comparison of cryptocurrency and traditional currency in relation to mechanism of its regulation may be required to support this paper’s results."
"Introduction:
Adjusting to a new classroom can be a daunting experience for both students and parents. However, with effective communication and parental involvement, this transition can be eased, enabling children to thrive academically and socially. In this essay, we will explore the significance of communication and parental involvement in supporting the adjustment process of new children in a classroom and provide examples of educational and communication techniques that educators can implement.
Importance of Communication:
Communication plays a pivotal role in creating a supportive environment for new children in a classroom. By fostering open lines of communication, educators can address any concerns or uncertainties that arise during the transition period. Regular communication channels between educators and parents help bridge any gaps in understanding, ensure a collaborative approach, and instill confidence in parents about their child's adjustment and progress.
Firstly, regular parent-teacher meetings or conferences provide an opportunity for educators to share insights, observations, and progress with parents. These meetings can not only help parents understand their child's assimilation into the classroom but also enable them to contribute valuable information about the child's interests, strengths, and challenges. Such collaboration facilitates personalized solutions to address any difficulties the child might face during the adjustment period.
Additionally, establishing effective communication channels through technology, such as online platforms or dedicated school apps, allows educators to regularly update parents about classroom activities, curriculum details, and any upcoming transitions. Ensuring transparency and involving parents in the decision-making process creates a sense of inclusivity and empowers them to actively participate in supporting their child's adjustment.
Parental Involvement:
Parental involvement is an indispensable aspect of a successful adjustment process for new students. When parents engage actively in their child's education, offering support and encouragement, children not only feel valued but also gain a sense of security and belonging within the educational community.
To encourage parental involvement, educators can organize orientation programs or welcome sessions, where parents can become familiar with the school environment, teachers, and curriculum. Such events provide an opportunity for parents to establish connections with other parents, fostering a support network that can help ease the adjustment period.
Another effective technique for educators is to involve parents in classroom activities, regardless of their physical presence. Through virtual parent involvement, parents can share their expertise, cultural backgrounds, or personal experiences via interactive video sessions, online discussions, or virtual presentations. This integration facilitates an inclusive learning environment and showcases the importance of diverse perspectives, positively impacting all students, including new children.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, effective communication and parental involvement play a vital role in supporting the adjustment process of new children in a classroom. By creating open lines of communication and involving parents in various aspects of their child's education, educators can ensure a smoother transition for both students and parents. Techniques such as regular parent-teacher meetings, technology-mediated communication channels, orientation programs, and virtual involvement can all contribute to a positive and inclusive classroom environment. By prioritizing communication and parental involvement, educators enable children to thrive academically, socially, and emotionally, paving the way for a successful academic journey."
"The chapter primarily focuses on the ethical evaluation of BP’s decisions in regards to spill management through the lens of utilitarianism. The latter considers an action ethical or unethical depending on the overall outcome and benefits (Halbert and Ingulli 1). When analyzing BP’s decisions and actions, it is important to include all stakeholders. Firstly, the cost-benefit analysis shows that BP incurred heavy losses due to fines, penalties, lawsuits, and damaged business. However, both long-term and short-term effects need to be considered. Secondly, shareholders of the company also incurred major losses.
Thirdly, the workers, who suffered from the spill, and other professionals were involved in the cleanup were killed, severely injured, or suffered other health effects. Fourthly, the Gulf area is a highly valuable ecosystem for fishing and other marine life forms. It is still unclear how massive the harm will be on the local fauna, but it is evident that the chemical particles will not magically disappear and will continue circulating in the ecosystem.
Fifthly, the local businesses, governments, and populations are heavily dependent on the Gulf’s ecosystem for a wide range of reasons. The spill impacted the fishing, tourism, and health of people living near the area. Although FDA claimed that seafood is safe to eat, it is still a question of time whether or not longitudinal health effects will occur (Halbert and Ingulli 3). Sixthly, the Gulf area is critical for the natural environment outside of it because fish, birds, and other marine life forms use the site for breeding, migration, and other patterns of behavior. Therefore, BP’s decision not to employ a backup switch will result in harmful consequences, but its decision to participate in deep-water drilling might equalize in terms of economic benefits to the nation."
"Cryptocurrency, a digital form of currency that utilizes cryptographic techniques to secure transactions, has emerged as a disruptive force in the financial market. Its decentralized nature and potential for anonymity have garnered considerable attention from investors, regulators, and the general public. While cryptocurrency holds promise as an alternative to traditional fiat currencies, it also presents inherent instability and associated consequences.
Firstly, the nature of cryptocurrency lies in its decentralized structure and the implementation of blockchain technology. Unlike traditional currencies issued and controlled by central banks, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum operate on a peer-to-peer network, allowing for secure, transparent, and efficient transactions. This decentralized nature eliminates the need for intermediaries, enabling direct and instant transfers across borders with minimal fees. Furthermore, cryptocurrencies can offer anonymity, making them attractive for users seeking privacy in their financial transactions.
Regarding the impact on the financial market, cryptocurrency has sparked both excitement and skepticism. On one hand, it has opened up new investment opportunities, allowing individuals to diversify their portfolios and potentially achieve high returns. Moreover, blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize various sectors beyond finance, including supply chain management, healthcare, and voting systems. These innovations could enhance efficiency, transparency, and security in traditional industries.
On the other hand, the volatility and instability associated with cryptocurrency have raised concerns among investors and regulators. The value of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate dramatically, often driven by speculation and market sentiment rather than underlying intrinsic value. This volatility can lead to potential consequences within the financial market. One consequence is the increased risk of financial losses for investors, as the value of their holdings can rapidly decline. Furthermore, the unregulated nature of cryptocurrency markets allows for potential manipulation, market abuse, and fraud.
Additionally, the instability of cryptocurrency can have wider implications for the overall financial system. If a significant number of individuals or entities were to suddenly lose confidence in cryptocurrencies, a domino effect could occur, potentially resulting in a market crash. Such an event could undermine trust in digital currencies, making it challenging for them to gain wider acceptance or adoption by mainstream institutions.
In conclusion, cryptocurrency's nature as a decentralized digital currency built on blockchain technology has disrupted the financial market, offering new investment opportunities and potential advancements in various sectors.

"As the global population ages, it becomes increasingly important to understand how age-related changes impact pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes in drug therapy for older adults. This essay aims to discuss the influences of age on these processes and their potential impacts on drug interventions and treatment regimens. Additionally, strategies will be proposed to improve the drug therapy plan for older adult patients while considering age-related physiological changes.
Pharmacokinetics refers to the movement of drugs within the body, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination. Age-related changes in gastrointestinal function can significantly affect drug absorption in older adults. Reduced gastric acid secretion and delayed gastric emptying may prolong drug absorption, leading to altered drug concentrations in the bloodstream. Additionally, changes in body composition, such as increased adipose tissue and decreased muscle mass, can affect drug distribution. Lipophilic drugs may accumulate in adipose tissue, resulting in prolonged drug effects and potential toxicity. Moreover, age-related changes in liver function can affect drug metabolism. Decreased liver blood flow and enzyme activity may result in decreased drug clearance, leading to increased drug concentrations and potential adverse effects. Lastly, age-related changes in kidney function can impact drug elimination. Reduced glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow may decrease drug excretion, resulting in prolonged drug half-lives and increased drug accumulation.
Pharmacodynamics, on the other hand, refers to how drugs exert their effects on the body. Age-related changes in receptor sensitivity and responsiveness can significantly impact drug efficacy and toxicity in older adults. For example, changes in the density and affinity of receptors can alter drug binding and subsequent signaling cascades. Older adults may exhibit increased sensitivity to certain drug classes, such as benzodiazepines and opioids, leading to an increased risk of side effects and drug toxicity. Furthermore, age-related changes in neurotransmitter systems, such as the dopaminergic and cholinergic systems, can affect drug response. Alterations in receptor function may result in decreased efficacy or increased toxicity of drugs acting on these systems.
Considering the potential impacts of age-related changes on drug interventions and treatment regimens, it is crucial to tailor drug therapy plans for older adult patients. Firstly, healthcare professionals should be aware of individual variations in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles among older adults. Regular monitoring of drug concentrations in the bloodstream can help prevent drug toxicity and ensure therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, dose adjustments may be necessary to account for age-related changes in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination. Prescribing lower initial doses and titrating upwards based on individual response and tolerance can help minimize adverse effects.
Furthermore, drug-drug interactions are more likely to occur in older adults due to polypharmacy, which can further complicate drug therapy. Regular medication reviews and comprehensive medication reconciliation by healthcare professionals can help identify potential drug-drug interactions and avoid polypharmacy-related adverse effects. Additionally, using medication review software and implementing medication therapy management programs can enhance communication between patients, healthcare providers, and pharmacists, ensuring the safe and effective use of medications.
To improve the drug therapy plan for older adult patients, it is essential to consider age-related physiological changes. Healthcare professionals should actively involve older adults in shared decision-making and educate them about the potential risks and benefits of medications. Promotion of non-pharmacological interventions, when appropriate, can also help reduce reliance on medications, minimize adverse effects, and improve overall patient outcomes. Regular physical activity, healthy diet choices, and appropriate sleep hygiene can positively impact both drug therapy outcomes and general health in older adults.
In conclusion, age-related changes in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes significantly impact drug therapy for older adult patients. Understanding these influences is crucial in designing drug therapy plans that minimize adverse effects and maximize therapeutic efficacy. Strategies to improve drug therapy for older adults should include regular monitoring, dose adjustments, medication reviews, and involvement of patients in decision-making. Ultimately, by considering age-related physiological changes and tailoring drug interventions accordingly, healthcare professionals can optimize the treatment regimens for older adult patients and improve their overall quality of life."
"Introduction (approximately 100 words)
The recent amendments to bail programs have raised concerns regarding their potential consequences and drawbacks. While these actions aimed to address issues related to pretrial release, it is crucial to critically evaluate their effectiveness and unintended adverse effects. This essay discusses the potential consequences and drawbacks of recent bail program amendments and emphasizes the need to revise and establish a more efficient framework for releasing individuals without bail.
Consequences and Drawbacks of Recent Bail Program Amendments (approximately 200 words)
The recent amendments to bail programs have led to numerous consequences and drawbacks that warrant concern. Firstly, the implementation of bail reform policies without comprehensive planning and monitoring has resulted in an increased risk of releasing potentially dangerous individuals into society. While the intention may be to alleviate pretrial detention for low-level offenders or those with limited financial means, lack of proper risk assessment has occasionally allowed for the release of those charged with serious offenses or exhibiting high flight risk.
Secondly, the absence of bail requirements has hindered the ability to ensure court appearance for individuals awaiting trial. Research suggests that individuals released without bail can be less motivated to appear for court hearings, leading to increased failure to appear rates. This jeopardizes the integrity of the judicial system and compromises public safety by allowing individuals charged with crimes to remain at large.
In addition, the elimination or reduction of monetary bail may inadvertently exacerbate socioeconomic disparities within the criminal justice system. Under the revised framework, individuals with significant financial resources can easily secure release, while those with limited means may remain incarcerated despite posing minimal risk. This perpetuates inequality and goes against the principle of equal treatment under the law.
The Need for a More Efficient and Revised Framework (approximately 300 words)
To address the consequences and drawbacks of recent bail program amendments, it is essential to establish a more efficient framework for releasing individuals without bail. Firstly, an improved risk assessment process should be implemented, incorporating evidence-based tools to determine an individual's likelihood of reoffending or failing to appear in court. By utilizing these tools and considering individual circumstances, the judicial system can better distinguish between those who can be safely released and those who pose a risk to public safety.
Moreover, a revised framework must prioritize resources for individuals released without bail, providing necessary support and supervision to ensure court appearance and community safety. This could involve the establishment of pretrial services agencies that offer comprehensive supervision, including reminder systems, referrals to social services, and regular check-ins. By actively engaging individuals released without bail, the chances of them successfully navigating the court process and reintegrating into society are significantly enhanced.
Additionally, recognizing and addressing socioeconomic disparities is crucial to establishing a fair and efficient pretrial release framework. One possible solution is the implementation of a sliding-scale system, where financial conditions for release are tailored according to an individual's means. Such an approach considers both the individual's ability to pay and the severity of the charges against them, ensuring bail determinations are not solely based on financial capabilities.
Conclusion (approximately 100 words)
While recent bail program amendments aimed to reduce inequalities and overcrowding in the criminal justice system, their consequences and drawbacks warrant a revision and the establishment of a more efficient framework for releasing individuals without bail. Through a comprehensive risk assessment process, prioritizing support systems, and addressing socioeconomic disparities, the judicial system can strike a balance between protecting public safety and ensuring equitable treatment for all individuals involved in the pretrial process. By striving for continuous improvement within our pretrial system, we can enhance fairness and achieve improved outcomes for both defendants and society as a whole."
"In her seminal work A Vindication of the Rights of Women, Mary Wollstonecraft argues that education is a necessary condition for developing virtue or ethical, right, and more ways of thinking and behavior. Wollstonecraft writes that learning and exercising one’s own reason are the only paths to developing virtue and women (Wollstonecraft 21). However, unlike men, women of the author’s time were limited in their access to education and had few opportunities to broaden their horizons. In this belief, Wollstonecraft echoed Plato and his Allegory of the Cave . In this work, the Greek philosopher argues that one’s perceptions may differ from reality, and people who are not allowed to receive knowledge will never know the real world (Plato). Thus, Wollstonecraft believes that women, equally to men, should be allowed the right to education as it affects them and the world around them.
In A Vindication of the Rights of Women, Mary Wollstonecraft insists that men and women are equal human beings and, therefore, should be offered the same rights and opportunities in life. The feminist writer argues that, although men and women are different in their nature, “their virtues should differ in respect to their nature” (Wollstonecraft 27). In saying this, Wollstonecraft holds men and women to the same moral standards and criticizes those who contend that a woman’s role in society should be reduced to ornamental function and childbearing. It can be argued that Wollstonecraft inspired the feminist movement, specifically, individualist feminist tradition, that emphasizes personal autonomy and individualism. In particular, her unwavering support of women’s right to education inspired many women to pursue learning, improve their knowledge of the world, and become more virtuous."
"A house is more than simply a place to live; in fact, that is only one description of a house. A home is a place where one feels more comfortable and looks forward to living through every day. A house is constructed not with stones or timbers but with the link of family. A person may own every materialistic property on the earth, but it would be not very sensible if he did not have someone with whom to exchange it. In other terms, expressing pleasure is also linguistically tied to home. Additionally, home is more than a physical location; it is a state of mind. They share a sense of joy and pleasure with their family members.
A home is when one understands they are around individuals who can run them nuts in a second and make them feel good in the very same second. Home signifies that no matter what one is experiencing or how difficult life becomes, there will always be someone watching out for them. When a person is secure enough to provide an honest account of themselves, they know they will be accepted definitively. For myself, I can single out a few places where I feel at home. This work was written with the aim of explaining one’s own concept of home and a place where a person feels at home.
For me, home is made up of memories of memorable moments that contributed to shaping and teaching me. As a result, my house is also people, and when home takes on a human figure, it is referred to as a family. I feel that family is a relative concept that is determined by connections rather than blood (Hess). No matter where I go in the future, this atmosphere and these individuals who have shaped me as a human and shown me how to behave will always be a strong foundation for me. I know I can always return home. Indeed, the spirit is where the household is.
Since college is where people spend most of their day, I feel at ease. My classmates, whom I have known for many years, are also at the same school. For instance, I have a friend in the same class as me who is like a sibling to me. We communicate a lot, and he knows all of my secrets. I have known him for years and consider him to be my best friend. All of my professors are familiar to me, and they are all delightful to me. They also instruct me and assist me with any problems I may have.
In this way, I can summarize and express what home for me is. In this essay, like a home, I show my family and the college where I study. For me, the feeling of home is the place where I can return at any time, and if not all, then one person can definitely help me. Home is a sense of calm and security, and for myself, I single out such a factor as communication. The house is the place where you studied something for a long time and communicated with people who, as a result, became close to me. Feeling at home is an essential feeling for every person because it gives people support and faith in themselves and their loved ones."

"In the case study, a subjective portion of the note provides a clear picture of the patient’s habitus, complaints, and anamnesis. However, it needs particularization about the last time the patient had unprotected sexual intercourse as it can help indicate the incubation period. The presence of similar skin defects at the patient’s recent sexual partners and the previous existence of similar skin defects on the patient’s skin and mucosae can define the duration of the disease and the episode number. The appearance of spread rash all over the patient’s body can indicate of duration and period of the disease. The intake of any medications, including antibiotics, for the last one month, can affect further diagnostics, tactics, and treatment plans; indicate fixed drug eruption. The patient’s anamnesis lacks gynecological questioning on menstruation details, number of pregnancies and abortions, and pregnancy prophylaxis. It is also significant to specify the patient’s travel history for differential diagnosis of chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), and granuloma inguinale (Afzal, 2020).
The objective notes should primarily include physical examination such as palpation of the lymph nodes because one of the significant signs of primary syphilis is regional lymphadenitis, and secondary syphilis manifests with systemic lymphadenopathy. The assessment of the skin and mucosae in the rectal area, periorbital space, mouth mucosa, examination per vaginam is also needed. Multiple chancres can occur if numerous sexual contacts with the contaminated partner during the recipient’s incubation period happened or if numerous locations of bacteria invasion during one sexual act took place. An attentive examination of oral mucosa can indicate Behçet disease if the ulcers in the mouth are painful and correlate with uveitis, skin lesions, muscular and joint pain, gastrointestinal symptoms.
The diagnostic tests should include tests for syphilis (VDRL together with darkfield microscopy or direct fluorescent antibody test), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HSV, DNA amplification tests for chancroid, and LGV (Roett, 2020). The last instanton in diagnostic search, if all previous tests are negative, should be a histological examination of a tissue biopsy searching for Donovan bodies specific for granuloma inguinale (Kang et al., 2019).
The assessment is mostly supported by objective data as tests results are the most trustworthy. A contingent of patients with STDs has peculiarities of providing false data to the doctor, and their anamnesis information should be critically evaluated. Syphilis is an appropriate diagnosis for this case, and test results can be used to confirm or reject it. It is significant to every medical worker to be concerned about syphilis; even though the disease is not spread overall, the impact on all systems and organs of the human body has dramatic consequences. Syphilis is one of the ancient diseases; still, current medicine lacks the alertness on its diagnosing as it may, for instance, mimic other oral manifestations (Dybeck Udd & Lund, 2016). As a differential diagnosis, HSV infection can be reviewed, and the differential search for it will be grouped vesicles on an erythematous background, leaving shallow ulcers (Vestergaard, 2018) afterward. Chancroid, or soft chancre, is caused by Haemophilus ducreyi, is spread in Africa and Asia, has an incubation period from 24 hours up to 15 days, and represents a painful ulcer located unilaterally (Agharbi, 2019).
Lymphogranuloma venereum is caused by L-serovars of chlamydia trachomatis and is spread in endemic regions of Africa, South-Eastern Asia, South, and Central America and manifests with inguinal and anorectal syndromes (Kand et al., 2019). Granuloma inguinale is caused by Klebsiella granulomatis and is endemical for South Africa, India, South China, and Brasilia, and ulcers tend to slowly enlarge and have raised rolled margins (Afzal, 2020). Behçet disease can also be used for differential diagnosis though it is a rare multisystemic disorder engaging several organs into the pathogenic process. The clinical picture is bright with painful and deep oral and genital ulcers, uveitis, and non-obligatory gastrointestinal, muscle, and joint involvement (Davatchi et al., 2017). Syphilis lesions are rarely painful, have a variety of skin elements, especially in the second period, and primary ulcer has a typic induration in the basement (Kang et al., 2019)."
"Introduction:
The Supreme Court's ruling on Static Control's claim under the Lanham Act clause of falsifying advertisement addresses critical issues surrounding the interpretation and application of this statute. This essay delves into the Court's interpretation of the statute and its reliance on traditional principles of statutory interpretation. Moreover, it discusses the arguments presented by Lexmark, primarily focusing on prudential standing, the concept of zone of interest, and the requirement of proximate cause.

This ruling sets an important precedent by widening the scope of authorized plaintiffs to sue and prevents companies from evading liability under the Lanham Act.
3. Prudential Standing and its implications:
Lexmark claimed that Static Control lacked prudential standing since it was not a direct competitor but rather a manufacturer of microchips utilized by Lexmark's competitors. The Supreme Court dismissed this argument, asserting that Static Control's close relationship with Lexmark's competitors gave it a viable interest in protecting their businesses against false advertising. By recognizing this broader interpretation of prudential standing, the Court ensured that indirect competitors can still enforce the Lanham Act's provisions, maintaining fairness and preventing deceptive marketing practices.
4. Traditional principles of statutory interpretation:
The Supreme Court resorted to traditional principles of statutory interpretation to resolve the case. It primarily focused on the plain language of the Lanham Act, giving weight to its original intent while also considering its contemporary context. By following these principles, the Court ensured the Act's objectives were upheld, promoting fair competition and protecting consumers from fraudulent advertising.
5. Static Control's qualification as an authorized plaintiff under §1125(a):
The Court determined that Static Control had a valid claim under §1125(a) of the Lanham Act, which prohibits false advertising that causes harm to a business's ""commercial interests."" It recognized that Static Control had a direct interest in selling its microchips to Lexmark's competitors, and Lexmark's misleading statements diminished their market viability. This ruling underscores the Act's broad reach, seeking to safeguard competition and prevent unfair practices that harm businesses engaged in lawful trade.
Conclusion:
In its analysis of the Supreme Court's ruling on Static Control's claim under the Lanham Act, this essay examines the Court's interpretation of the statute and its application of traditional principles of statutory interpretation.

Specifically, this analysis will focus on racial bias and its effects on structural levels within society.
Body:
Bias Manifestations:
Smith's TED Talk sheds light on implicit bias, emphasizing how preconceived notions shape our perceptions, decisions, and behavior. These biases, often unconscious, perpetuate stereotypes and hinder social inclusion. Abdel-Magied's TED Talk examines the intersectionality of biases, such as gender, religion, and race, elucidating how multiple layers of discrimination further marginalize individuals.
Effects on Individuals' Self-esteem and Confidence:
Racial bias significantly impacts individuals' self-esteem and confidence. Discrimination based on skin color or ethnicity often leads to feelings of inferiority and internalized racism. Individuals, especially those from marginalized groups, may struggle to assert their voice, encountering societal barriers to personal growth and professional opportunities. Additionally, persistent experiences of bias erode self-worth, limiting individuals' aspirations and diluting their potential contributions to society.
Effects on Structural Levels within Society:
Racial bias perpetuates inequalities at structural levels within society. The New York Times article highlights how institutional practices, such as hiring decisions, educational policies, and criminal justice systems, are influenced by racial biases. These biases foster systemic inequalities, leading to a lack of representation, unequal access to resources, and perpetuation of socio-economic disparities. Consequently, the excluded individuals face limited opportunities for personal growth and advancement, reinforcing the cycle of discrimination.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, bias and discrimination have significant implications on social inclusion, self-esteem, and confidence. By exploring the TED Talks by Smith (2015) and Abdel-Magied (2014) alongside The New York Times article (2016), it becomes apparent that biases manifest in various forms and perpetuate inequalities within society. Racial bias, in particular, hampers individuals' self-esteem and confidence while simultaneously influencing structural levels of society. Recognizing the adverse effects of bias and discrimination is crucial for promoting a more inclusive society, where individuals can freely express themselves and contribute without fear of exclusion or marginalization. Taking conscious efforts to challenge biases and embrace diversity will pave the way for a more equitable future."
"The transfer of electrons in the electron transport chain (ETC) plays a crucial role in the generation of a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This process occurs through a series of redox reactions involving multiple protein complexes embedded within the membrane. The movement of electrons along this chain leads to the pumping of protons across the membrane, creating an electrochemical gradient that serves as a potent source of energy in ATP synthesis. Additionally, protons play a vital role in compensating for potential imbalances in the membrane charge, ensuring the maintenance of proper cellular function.
To understand how electrons in the ETC generate a proton gradient, it is essential to comprehend the molecular machinery involved. The ETC consists of four main protein complexes: I, II, III, and IV, along with coenzyme Q and cytochrome c. Electrons extracted from high-energy molecules, such as NADH and FADH2, enter the chain at Complex I and II, respectively. These electrons then travel through a series of redox reactions, ultimately arriving at Complex IV, where they combine with oxygen to form water.
During this transfer of electrons, large amounts of energy are released and used to actively pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, from the matrix to the intermembrane space. Complexes I, III, and IV contribute to this pumping of protons, while Complex II bypasses it. At each complex, electrons pass through several prosthetic groups, such as flavin mononucleotide (FMN), iron-sulfur clusters, and heme groups, which actively pump protons against their concentration gradient.
The released energy from electron transfer is utilized by these protein complexes to transport protons across the membrane. This process creates an imbalance in proton concentration, resulting in a higher concentration of protons in the intermembrane space compared to the matrix. The consequent electrochemical gradient generated is of paramount importance for cellular function, serving as a driving force for ATP synthesis and other vital processes.
Protons, or H+ ions, are positively charged particles that exert an influential effect on the overall charge balance of the inner mitochondrial membrane. The mitochondrial membrane is usually impermeable to ions, including protons, due to its lipid bilayer structure. This property allows the proton gradient to form and be maintained, as it cannot easily dissipate across the membrane. The movement of protons from the intermembrane space back to the matrix occurs through a specialized protein complex known as ATP synthase.
ATP synthase acts as a molecular rotary motor, utilizing the energy released from the re-entry of protons to generate ATP. As protons flow through ATP synthase, their potential energy is harnessed to phosphorylate ADP to ATP. This process, known as oxidative phosphorylation, is the primary mechanism by which the majority of ATP is produced in aerobic organisms. The presence of a proton gradient generated by the electron transport chain is crucial for this ATP synthesis, highlighting the significance of protons in compensating for potential imbalances in the membrane charge.
The role of protons extends beyond energy production. Electrochemical gradients created by proton pumping also facilitate numerous cellular processes, such as active transport, metabolite exchange, and regulation of membrane potential. These processes rely on the controlled movement of ions across the mitochondrial membrane, which is heavily influenced by the proton gradient. Thus, protons act as key regulators of cellular homeostasis and play a vital role in maintaining the proper functioning of the inner mitochondrial membrane.
In conclusion, the transfer of electrons in the electron transport chain generates a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This process involves the active pumping of protons by protein complexes, leading to a higher concentration of protons in the intermembrane space compared to the matrix. Protons have a critical role in compensating for potential imbalances in the membrane charge, ensuring proper cellular function and energy production. The electrochemical gradient created by the proton gradient serves as a driving force for ATP synthesis, as well as other essential processes, ultimately vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis."
"A disaster preparedness plan starts with an emergency preparedness kit that must necessarily include drinking water for each person, a supply of food for several days, a radio receiver for listening to information. Moreover, it is important to have a flashlight and extra batteries in case of a long stay in an emergency. Additionally, the kit should include a dust mask and a whistle that can be used as an alert or help signal. If it is not possible to turn off utilities, it is essential to put pliers and a can opener in order to open the food.
When preparing for an emergency, there are many other factors that influence action. There is a paralyzed person in the family, so it is critical to have a stretcher in case you have to leave the house. If circumstances do not allow the use of a stretcher, special bandages are needed in order to carry a person on their back. Moreover, the package should include all first aid supplies such as bandages, painkillers, and wound dressings. In this case, help can be provided in the event of injuries of varying degrees. One family member has asthma, so several inhalers are prepared in the kit. If they break, then it is necessary to use baking soda during an attack of illness. 1 tablespoon of soda is added to 1 liter of water; the vapors need to be inhaled for 5-7 minutes. Such alkaline inhalations help clear the bronchi, remove phlegm and relieve inflammation when coughing.
Additionally, it is necessary not to panic, as calmness is the boundary between life and death. With the loss of calmness and peace of mind, a person begins to commit rash acts that can lead to death (Aruru et al., 2021). The implementation of the plan should begin by checking the supply of water and food. Moreover, I need to make sure that all members of the family are intact. After that, I will turn on the radio and listen to messages from the rescue services. In the absence of communication, it is important to remain calm and give distress signals with a whistle. The success of the plan should be judged according to the level of calmness and readiness for different circumstances."

Genetics and genomics refer to two concepts that keenly study genes which are the basic operational unit of a living organism. Both genetics and genomics offer invaluable insights into the structure and function of the human body. The knowledge acquired from these two fields is vital in dictating the development of medicine and other health sciences. This essay is an analysis of these two fields and consists of six crucial sections. The first part differentiates genetics from genomics, enabling the distinction between the two disciplines. The second section offers invaluable insight into the role of nursing in the two fields. The third section highlights the ethical consideration in research into the two fields. The fourth dwells on the global utilization of genetics and genomics research while the fifth is an analysis of the influence of various factors on the utilization of genomics and genetics in healthcare. The final section is the conclusion that pieces together the knowledge from all the sections and offers direction. Genetics and genomics are amongst the fastest-growing fields that highlight the next crucial stage in healthcare development hence their value is undeniable.
Differences Between Genetics and Genomics
Genetics refers to study of genes and their functions in the inheritance of various traits amongst humans. This field analyzes how human beings pass down various characteristics to their offspring and the processes involved in the transfer (Marchant et al., 2020). This study also analyzes the impact of the genes transferred to various people. Genes are the primary unit studied in genetics and this term refers to basic units of heredity. Genes carry instructions that direct the manufacture of various proteins within the body. These instructions coordinate the manufacture of proteins such as hormones, enzymes, cells, and muscles.
These proteins are crucial in regulating various biological functions including sleep, growth and reproduction, breathing, digestion, and cognitive activity amongst others (Marchant et al., 2020). Genetics also identifies the diseases that can occur whenever an error is encountered in the ability of genes to direct the activity of the body. These diseases include cystic fibrosis, Huntington’s disease, and phenylketonuria and exhibit heredity (Marchant et al., 2020). This implies that the study of genetics can identify people at a high risk of developing these diseases and predict whether offspring can have them.
Genomics on the other hand is a recent terminology that describes the analysis of all of a human’s genes, referred to as the genome. It investigates the interaction of these genes with each other and the person’s environment. Genomics also studies complex diseases such as heart disease, asthma, diabetes, and cancer since these diseases are caused by genetic variation. Genomics aims to offer new possibilities for therapy, diagnostic procedures, and treatment for some complex diseases (Marchant et al., 2020). One of the most remarkable contributions of genomics is stem cell therapy that enables the replacement of the faultiest cells in the body using cells referred to as stem cells. These stem cells can develop into any human cell and are therefore cultured with this sole purpose. Once ripe, these cells are used to replace injured body organs and ensure healing.
The Role of Nursing in Genetics and Genomics
Nursing ensures the role of genetics and genomics through its involvement in research. The nursing profession encourages the involvement of professionals in research initiatives that enable the growth of this field (Beery et al., 2018). Additional research enables the discovery of new knowledge that is vital in ensuring disease is combated. Nursing also contributes to genomics through the popularization of the alternatives presented by these specialties. Nurses are some of the most exposed healthcare professionals, dealing with many patients. Their widespread interaction provides them with an opportunity to impact knowledge to millions of people whenever healthcare scenarios befitting the genomics alternatives are presented. Nursing also provides nurses with an opportunity to venture into a specialty of genetics called genetic nursing.
The professionals within this field are called genetic nurses. The involvement of specialists within this specific field ensures that the specialty is accorded the serious focus it deserves. Genetic nurses are availed with ample time to focus on this field and propagate its growth through research and experimentation. The implementation of the techniques with a genetic background ensures that treatments with this base are fast-tracked and approved.
Nursing ensures that the fields of genetics and genomics achieve practice and approval through the various nursing organizations. Global and national nursing associations have been at the forefront of ensuring that genetics and genomics are approved by the governments and global associations such as the WHO. This involves implementing their advisory mandate to the leaders in the healthcare fields and directing them to approve genetics and genomics (Hickey et al., 2018). These efforts have put adequate pressure on these organizations to offer sufficient funding to this research and also approve clinical trials of the various suggested genetics methods. The increased attention by governments and healthcare organizations has in turn caused an increase in the usage of these services in general and the growth of this field. Accessibility for more people has also been made possible with developing nations also embracing this revolution in healthcare.
Ethical Considerations with Research Involving Genetics and Genomics
When genetic and genomic research occurs, the data on the genomic sequence of individuals is required to be accessible to these participants. When this data is availed, it may reveal disturbing discoveries such as the possibility of developing cancer within the next few years. This is worrying for a patient who was previously unaware of the possibility and may cause anxiety in the patient and their families (Coughlin, 2020). The ethical issue of whether human beings want to be aware of what is happening in their bodies arises here. Additionally, the individual may be informed of the possibility of the occurrence of a chronic illness such as diabetes from genetic research. This disease may fail to occur and cause unnecessary worry and panic for the individual and their family, causing widespread mistrust in genetics and genomics.
Alternatively, the information about an individual may be discovered and withheld by the researchers. The aftermath of this is that a patient may develop the discovered condition and succumb to the disease partly due to late discovery and inadequate preparation. In this situation, the researcher is seen to have committed ethical injustice to the participant and harm public trust (Coughlin, 2020). In other scenarios, the researcher may be required to reveal the data collected on the genetic differences between the individuals participating. The variations may display some individuals negatively with a myriad of conditions likely to affect them in the future. In the unanticipated circumstances when employers or health insurance companies access this information, they are likely to discriminate against people.
Employers are likely to offer opportunities to individuals unlikely to develop a chronic disease that would be unprofitable due to sick leaves. Insurance companies are also likely to charge people with the likelihood of developing chronic diseases differently from others. This creates the issue of inequality and possible discrimination based on genetic predisposition.
How Genetics and Genomics Research is Conducted and Utilized Globally
Genetic and genomics research is conducted in willing individuals whenever the researchers have a specific hypothesis to test. The research requires the necessary approval from all the organizations involved including the government institutions involved. This research requires the involvement of high-level technology that enables the analysis of the data. Additionally, researchers must collect samples from their participants or patients, extract the genetic information, and carry out the tests required (Stark et al., 2019). Genetic research is conducted whenever researchers want to establish the impact of certain environmental factors on various human aspects. This research is also conducted whenever there is a need to establish the possibility of certain individuals developing certain conditions. This is mainly guided by heredity whereby one family member contracts a certain disease and there is a need to rule out the possibility of others having the same disease.
Genetics and genomics research has been vital in advancing cloning, a technique that replicates exact copies of desired organisms or cells. Cloning is vital in developing identical cells for a certain organ and replacing the damaged cells in that specific organ (Brown, 2020). Cloning identifies the exact genetic composition of the damaged cells and initiates protocols that generate replicas. This includes the generation of cells for a damaged liver where a researcher acquires cells from the victim.
They sequence these cells and grow replicates of the liver cells before replacing them to ensure the patient has a functional liver. Genetics and genomics have also been vital in the development of medicines for the treatment of various conditions. The study of the genes and the various processes involved has been crucial in enabling researchers to identify certain pathways that can be manipulated (Morrell et al., 2019). Upon identification of a pathway that is affected in the occurrence of a certain disease, researchers develop medicines that target this mechanism. The drugs rectify the error and prevent the occurrence of the anticipated disease or reverse the damage to assure health for the victim.
Impact of Culture on Genetic/Genomics
Genetics and genomics are well-advanced fields in healthcare that have achieved massive challenges in usage due to cultural and religious beliefs. Some people may have access to these services but avoid using them due to the belief that such scientific advances contravene their beliefs (Modell et al., 2019). Certain religions discourage their members from seeking scientific medical care due to the stigma associated with this form of healthcare. This includes using fields such as genetics due to the belief that modern practices interfere with their faith. They believe that scientific research is akin to competing with their supreme deity and that such investigations are too detailed for the liking of their supreme being. Some religions believe that science competes with the perfect work of creation executed by their deity. They encourage their believers to subscribe to the things taught and to disregard genetic and genomic medical aid, hence minimal usage.
Some health beliefs are misled and encourage people to wait in earnest for recovery and this has led to the deaths of people who could be helped. Some family values encourage the treatment of members who become enlightened and compassionate towards genetics with distaste. They treat these people as outcasts and discourage associating with these people within their spheres of influence. Some people, though knowledgeable, avoid association with genetics and genomics out of the fear of banishment due to traditions. The traditions highlight extensive reliance on outdated health practices. The culture of mistrust towards western medicine that birthed genetics and genomics is widespread in some parts of the world (Scherr et al., 2019). This is due to the dark history associated with western medicine such as human experimentation and torture. The dark ages highlighted a period of medical advancement at the expense of the lives of innocent people. The experimentation was brutal and sometimes without anesthesia, hence the pain. People who have heard stories about how western medicine oppressed their ancestors are apprehensive towards genetics and genomics.
Conclusion
In conclusion, genetics and genomics are crucial healthcare fields and promise to revolutionize the handling of disease and health. Genetics deals with the study of genes and their influence in inheritance while genomics prioritizes the entire human genome with an aim of combating genetic diseases. There is a surge of healthcare professionals oriented to prioritize these fields, including nurses. Nurses play a key role in familiarizing genetics and genomics with most of their patients while contributing to research that increases available knowledge. Genetics and genomics encounter ethical challenges due to the impact of the knowledge discovered during genetic research.
The research acquired from genetics and genomics has been vital in bettering cloning and pharmacokinetics. This is essential as it promises to combat more diseases through prevention before their occurrence and cure before their deterioration. Genetics and genomics also encounter difficulties arising from family differences and religious differences. There is a need for widespread sensitization amongst all people on the importance of genetics and genomics. Further research into the two is also paramount to ensure more alternative treatment protocols are discovered and perfected for the sake of the patients."
"Gnomial Functions Inc. wants to determine the most reliable forecasting technique for determining the sales level for the next eighteen months. The sales trend reflected a consistent increase over the last 18 months with minimal seasonal variation. However, the sales for recent months reflected had more significance on the following months sales (Wisniewski, 2016). Consequently, Gnomial Functions Inc. should use the weighted moving average to forecast the most likely level of sales.
The weighted moving average used four weights to determine the likely level of sales in the next month. These weights ranged from 0.1 to 0.4 for the earliest and most recent months respectively. The most recent data received a higher weight due to its higher relevance to the future level of sales. Consequently, the weighted moving average generates accurate forecast compared to the simple moving averages.
The company can realize even more accurate forecast by adjusting the weights for the moving average. The management should give higher weight to the recent monthly sales to reduce the forecasting error. Specifically, the mean absolute deviation and mean standard error for the initial weights (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4) was 6.27 and 47.29. In contrast, when the new weights that give more importance to the recent performance (0, 0, 0.4, and 0.6) are applied, the mean absolute deviation declined to 4.81, and the mean standard error declines to 27.28. This performance is better than the simple moving average.
Gnomial Functions Inc. should use the weighted moving average to determine the likely level of sales in the next year. This method is simple, effective, and reliable. In addition, it can be adjusted to reflect the changes in sales trend by adjusting the weights to give the requisite importance to the recent months. Therefore, the company should use weighted moving average to estimate the likely performance in the coming year."
"The epic poem Beowulf, written in the 8th century, has had a profound influence on modern popular culture. This ancient tale of heroism, courage, and loyalty has found its way into various forms of media and has served as a foundation for the creation of contemporary superheroes. While the characteristics of epic heroes and modern superheroes share certain similarities, the perception of heroes in contemporary times has transformed significantly. Factors contributing to the complexity of modern heroes include the evolving social and cultural contexts, the blurring boundaries between good and evil, and the increasing demand for relatability.
Beowulf, the archetype of an epic hero, possesses traits that have become synonymous with modern superheroes. Like Superman and Batman, Beowulf exhibits exceptional physical strength, unmatched bravery, and a fierce determination to protect and serve. Both Beowulf and modern superheroes overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges, battling villains to maintain peace and justice within their respective realms. This parallel between Beowulf and modern superheroes demonstrates the enduring influence of the epic poem.
However, the perception of heroes in contemporary times has undergone a remarkable change. Unlike Beowulf, modern superheroes are multifaceted characters with complex backgrounds and internal conflicts that reveal their human vulnerabilities. Iron Man, for instance, battles not only external foes but also his own inner demons. As society has become more nuanced and aware of human follies, modern heroes reflect the struggles and imperfections that exist within each of us.
This complexity in modern heroes can be attributed to several factors, including the evolving social and cultural contexts in which they are created. In today's interconnected world, with audiences increasingly diverse and globally connected, there is a pressing need for heroes to resonate with a broader range of individuals. The traditional, infallible hero archetype no longer satisfies the desire for storytelling that acknowledges the complexities of humanity. Audiences now demand heroes who are more relatable, flawed, and morally ambiguous.
In conclusion, the influence of Beowulf on modern popular culture is undeniable. The characteristics of Beowulf as an epic hero have been emulated in modern superheroes, while the perception of heroes has evolved significantly. The complexity that defines modern heroes is a product of the changing social and cultural contexts, the blurring distinctions between good and evil, and the demand for relatability. These factors have reshaped the narrative of heroism, reflecting the dynamic and multifaceted nature of the modern world."

"The novel Atonement , written by Ian McEwan, touches upon the topic of the significance of writing. The author uses various literary devices to convey many themes within the novel. Using the omniscient narrator, the author strives to show a person’s emotions who tries to atone the sins through writing. The image of the main character of the novel, Briony, shows how the writing can help people to accept their own sins. The author uses the different types of irony and omniscient narrator mode to reflect the idea of alleviating grief and guilt through writing.
The significance of writing and narrative to coping with guilt, loss, or trauma is expressed primarily through two literary devices. The first one is the irony: situational and verbal. The irony is a satirical technique by which the writer evaluates the subject involving double meaning. The truth lies not in the statement but in its opposite meaning. The author uses verbal irony to convey the emotions of the characters in more detail. “Now you’re sticking to the salad while the rest of us are suffering” (121). This type of irony is used to condemn the narrator’s behavior. Such writing structure is a way to plead guilty in the actions causing the sufferings to others. “When the wounded were screaming, you dreamed of sharing a little house somewhere” (227). This quote also contains the narrator’s conviction to her actions against the loved ones.
Creating a novel, the narrator wants to grant characters the opportunity to live lives they had no chance to live. The narrator emphasizes that she has stolen the lives of the people she loved. People cannot be brought back to life, and the narrator has no chance to be forgiven. Thus, she creates a novel where she can atone her sins. The situational irony is used to depict the narrator’s remorse trying to use the writing to cope with the loss. At the end of the book, the narrator confesses that the reuniting of characters had never happened (310). The happy ending exists because she decides to atone for her own sins through the novel. Being unable to change their lives, the writer creates a new life for these people in the story.
Another element helping to express the mentioned topic is the omniscient narrator mode. In such novels, the narrator simultaneously acts as a character and identifies himself with the first person pronoun “I”. Such a narrator makes it possible to effectively express the thoughts and feelings of the narrator, hidden and inaccessible to an external observer, opening the way to various forms of self-observation. “How can a novelist achieve atonement when, with her absolute power of deciding outcomes, she is also God?” (325). This example shows that the narrator considers writing as an alleviating measure helping to overcome the loss. However, the narration mode allows the reader to understand that the narrator wants to be with the loved ones and cannot overcome being separated with them. Actually, the reader realizes that the atonement was impossible for the narrator. Through writing, she devotes her life to the people whose lives she ruined. Even though Briony’s mental trauma cannot be potentially atoned, she alleviates her grief and guilty through writing.
The discussed issue is vital for me personally and the whole society in terms of understanding the writer’s emotions. Life is uncontrollable, and many events that haunt people all their lives may occur. Everyone finds their own way to overcome the traumas. Writing is the perfect opportunity to stay faithful to loved ones and express one’s regrets. It is morally relieving when the audience reads and accepts the author’s confessions. For me, writing may help stay morally stable and remember losses and tragedies, which is vital for the ethical development and cultural heritage transferring of society."

Addressing this issue is crucial to ensure the health and well-being of the aging population in the United States."
"Coronavirus disease is a rapidly growing worldwide pandemic due to severe pulmonary and syndrome coronavirus 2, henceforth increased pessimism and high loss of lives. It was first discovered in Wuhan (China) in a cluster of pneumonia patients with acute respiratory illness. The pandemic presents an unrivaled challenge to public healthcare and food systems (Alcendor, 2020). As governments try to curb this scourge through border closures, trade restrictions, and confinement measures, it has crippled economies. Beyond impacting the economy and healthcare, it has debilitating effects on many families globally.
Disparities in knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) levels exist regarding COVID. White people are perceived to likely have high knowledge and confidence associated with a high level of education and income compared to their non-white counterparts, who were likely to have a low level of education and attitude but are viewed as high practice responders (Alcendor, 2020). Race, sex, education, income, health insurance status, and political views are all associated with KAPs.
Hispanic and African- Americans have a higher infection rate and the number of deaths, despite being minority races. African-Americans had many deaths in Chicago and Louisiana despite being a minority, consisting of roughly a third of the population. These undermine the social determinants in health, socio-economic disparities, and prevalent racial disparities in health outcomings in the USA. In NEW YORK, 34% of COVID-related deaths were Hispanics, who consist of almost a third of the population (Alobuia et al., 2020).
Concerning knowledge of COVID, a higher percentage of white people had a slightly higher knowledge than Hispanics or African-Americans, who scored lower in a study done by the Kaiser Family Foundation “KFF Coronavirus poll” conducted between 11 and 15 march 2020 on people living in the USA. It’s, therefore, easy to say a majority of White people had exposure to information on COVID compared to their Hispanic and African-American counterparts. The socio-demographical racial disparities are evident as areas with a high population of Hispanics and African-Americans lacked the correct knowledge on the COVID virus.
Univariate analysis shows that African-Americans and Hispanics have a higher attitude towards COVID, positive or negative, than the White race. These can be highly attributed to the higher number of white people with higher health insurance than other races in the US. Similarly, income highly affects attitude, and those with high income annually were fewer attitudes than small-income earners (Alobuia et al., 2020). Higher levels of education and political stands are some of the major factors leading to a higher attitude among Whites than other races.
Hispanic and African-Americans have a higher practice rate than Whites in the US. These can be attributed to exposure to the effects of the virus and not knowledge of the virus. The correlation between knowledge and practice is minimal in this case (Alobuia et al., 2020). COVID has affected a lot of social norms and cultural practices among minority races more than whites, hence the higher number of practices among them. In conclusion, despite having lower knowledge and more negative experiences, minority races are likely to engage in safe practices to minimize the spread and infection of COVID.
Many measures have been put in place to minimize the spread of COVID. These directives may reduce the spread but having the correct knowledge and a positive attitude can affect how we relate to COVID. It also leads to more empowerment and inclusivity in decision-making among minorities. Racial disparities in KAP exist globally. A racial and financial divergence exists in the degrees of KAPs connected with COVID-19. More work is expected to distinguish instructive apparatuses customized to explicit racial and socio-economic groups."
"Introduction (approx. 100 words)
Plato, the influential Greek philosopher, employs various rhetorical devices in his writings to express his perspective on reality and emphasize the importance of self-reconfiguration. This essay will delve into the ways in which Plato utilizes these devices, including dialogue, analogy, and imagery, to effectively convey his point of view. By exploring Plato's philosophical concepts and analyzing his rhetoric, we can gain insight into his belief that an individual's pursuit of truth and self-transformation are integral components of a fulfilling and meaningful existence.
Body Paragraph 1: Dialogue as a Rhetorical Device (approx. 200 words)
Plato's use of dialogue as a rhetorical device is evident throughout his works, most notably in ""The Republic."" By employing conversations between Socrates and various interlocutors, Plato conveys his perspectives on reality. Through these dialogues, Plato skillfully presents opposing viewpoints and engages readers in critical thinking. For instance, in ""The Allegory of the Cave,"" Plato illustrates his belief that individuals are initially trapped in an ignorant world of shadows, representing the illusory reality most individuals accept uncritically. Through Socratic questioning, Plato encourages self-reflection and prompts readers to question the nature of their reality.
Body Paragraph 2: Analogy as a Rhetorical Device (approx. 200 words)
In addition to dialogue, Plato often employs analogies as powerful rhetorical devices to communicate complex philosophical concepts. The ""Forms"" is one such concept. Through the analogy of the ""Divided Line,"" Plato conveys the hierarchy of reality, suggesting that the physical world merely reflects a shadowy realm, while true knowledge can be attained through intellect and reason. This analogy serves as a compelling tool to convey Plato's point of view on reality – that there exists a higher realm of ideals that forms the foundation of our existence.
Body Paragraph 3: Imagery as a Rhetorical Device (approx. 200 words)
Plato utilizes vivid imagery as another rhetorical device to convey his point of view. In ""Phaedrus,"" Plato employs the myth of the ""Chariot Allegory"" to symbolize the complexities of the human soul. The image of two horses pulling a chariot, representing reason and desire, emphasizes the need for individuals to harmonize their rational and irrational impulses. This imagery highlights Plato's belief in the importance of self-reconfiguration, as individuals must strive for balance and self-mastery to attain a higher level of existence.
Body Paragraph 4: Conveying the Necessity of Self-Reconfiguration (approx. 200 words)
Throughout his writings, Plato consistently emphasizes the necessity of self-reconfiguration as a core element in the pursuit of truth and the realization of an ideal reality. He argues that individuals must actively engage in self-examination, questioning their beliefs and assumptions, in order to transcend the limitations of the physical world. By emphasizing the transformative power of philosophy and self-reflection, Plato contends that individuals can align themselves with the eternal truths of the intelligible realm, leading to personal growth and enlightenment.
Conclusion (approx. 100 words)
In conclusion, Plato effectively employs rhetorical devices such as dialogue, analogy, and imagery to convey his unique perspectives on reality and the need for self-reconfiguration. Through his dialogues, analogies, and vivid imagery, Plato urges individuals to critically examine their perceptions and pursue truth through self-reflection. By embracing the transformative power of philosophy and striving for self-reconfiguration, individuals can transcend the limited realms of the physical world and attain a deeper understanding of reality. Plato's philosophies continue to resonate today, highlighting the enduring value of his rhetorical techniques in conveying his profound insights."
"Introduction
The appearance of material and monetary resources is the starting and initial point of forming a bottomless and wide gap between several people. From now on, the world has split into “two camps,” and individuals are classified not only by physical, personal or mental characteristics but also by the principle of having specific benefits. Today, there are both rich and poor citizens in any country, and sometimes the ratio between them is exceptionally remote. Nevertheless, each person is equal, less or more dependent on each other since they live in a society. Dedication is a vital sign of a spiritually rich, profoundly and broadly thinking person who has not lost human and compassionate qualities.
Responding to the Ideas
The main idea and thought of the passage is self-feedback, dedication and selflessness, regardless of the amount of money and the availability of precious items. According to Andrew Carnegie, any wealth requires sharing and returning to those who need exceptional help and support. Everyone should recognize their qualities for the sake of the whole society. Accordingly, if the rich continue to get prosperous, ignoring the poverty of others, this will lead the entire society to decline, and the rich themselves will also suffer. Indeed, wealthy people should give part of their capital to the impoverished. They are obliged to use their skills and means to fight poverty and help needy people get out of deprivation.
Undoubtedly, the achievement of wealth, if it is not inherited, will require a lot of effort and time. However, this does not always bring the desired happiness, and this reflection most often turns out much later. Many individuals, realizing that wealth does not make them happy, cannot give up their habitual way of life. Therefore, that is why it is worth understanding what one really wants. For instance, Carnegie realized that money is not a goal or even a means to achieve it, but only an accompanying attribute. Thus, the man collected the necessary amount to take his time, not chase money, live in pleasure, enjoy the calm flow of days and live one day.
Conclusion
In conclusion, any good earned by a person requires dedication and devotion. Some people lack the opportunity to have enough money and funds for the best life because of external or internal factors. Undoubtedly, Carnegie worked a lot, but there is a high probability that the man got to the right time and place. He realized in time that wealth does not bring him happiness, and one can obtain joy and pleasure even simply with the help of “small,” kind gestures – sharing and dedication."
"The healthcare system is currently under significant strain due to the COVID 19 pandemic. The problems of supply and staff shortages in healthcare have existed before but have now worsened. In particular, the issue of shortage of medical supplies is noticeable in the outpatient surgical setting where I work. This problem is directly related to the existing principles of building supply chains in healthcare, which should be subject to change. In this situation, John’s Kotter steps in leading change can become a framework for bringing positive results.
The main advantage of this theory is the holistic approach to making changes. Most importantly, Kotter’s theory includes eight steps that are based on the formation and communication of a vision of the need for change (Beauvais & Spahn, 2018). Additionally, this theory is most useful, as it allows innovation to be introduced at a structural rather than purely organizational level. With regard to the described problem, this aspect is the most significant. Eight steps suggested by Kotter that could help in the successful implementation of changes are described below.
 1. The first step is to create a sense of urgency for change. Kotter notes that it takes about 75% of supporters to successfully create a sense of urgency (Beauvais & Spahn, 2018, p. 255). This can be achieved through discussions with other nurses and providing information on how the shortage of supplies negatively affects the quality of care and patient outcomes.
 2. Successful implementation of change requires building a coalition through the practice of effective leadership. On the issue, you need to work with representatives of other healthcare units and organizations to acquire more supporters. At this stage, it is important to find influential associates who could make the problem public.
 3. At this stage, it is necessary to create a vision and a strategy corresponding to it. In particular, it is important to provide people not only with evidence of the existence of the problem and its consequences but also to indicate the overall goal of changes. Additionally, it is necessary to articulate how changes in supply chains, as well as a focus on planning and forecasting, can make a significant difference.
 4. After that, it is important to communicate the vision, for which it is necessary to use every opportunity. Structural changes are needed in relation to the problem, which complicates the process of introducing changes. At this stage, it is critical to articulate the vision not only among colleagues but also in the medical community as a whole. This will help in expanding the publicity of the issue as well as acquiring supporters.
 5. A key aspect for a leader is also to stimulate action and remove barriers to change. In particular, the aspirations of nurses and their active work to implement the strategy need to be supported and inspired. It is also important to identify those who oppose change and try to convince them of the need for it.
 6. For effective implementation, it is also necessary to achieve short-term results, which will become an indicator of the possibility of change. As part of solving the problem, even expanding the publicity of its existence can be a victory. To successfully resolve an issue, it is important that organizations recognize the need for long-term supply planning.
 7. After each small success within the strategy, it is important to evaluate the results and adjust the plan. It is critical for a leader to consider what opportunities for change in supply management are open and how they can be effectively used.
Finally, it is necessary to root the change in the organizational culture. With regard to the problem, this should be done at the structural level through maintaining publicity and active discussion of supply management change initiatives."
"The two stories “The Tell-Tale Heart” by Edgar Allen Poe and “The Gift of the Magi” by O. Henry were examples of their authors’ writing talent. O. Henry and Poe were writers from separate eras; however, some similarities can be found in these stories, especially in terms of literary techniques employed. At the same time, the two stories differ in that they adopt distinct approaches to societal tensions and emphasize various parts of these and challenges.
“The Gift of the Magi” deals with a couple named James and Della, who eventually sold their most valuable belongings to buy each other presents for Christmas. Della discovers a set of pricey ornate hair combs, but they are worthless because she chopped off her hair to purchase Jim a chain for his watch, which he subsequently sold to give her a gift (O. Henry). In certain socioeconomic situation (the couple is impoverished), O. Henry employs irony to show the situation in which a person can give up the most precious thing to show love.
The major components of which “The Gift of the Magi” is being built up are irony and selfless love. While O. Henry’s story explores the positive aspects of these concepts, Poe delves into more negative, darker dimensions through the narratives of mental disorder. “The Gift of the Magi” became one of the foremost literary examples of irony (Sushma). Jim and Della offer their most valued belongings in this case so that the others might completely appreciate their gift. Jim sells his watch to purchase Della’s combs, anticipating that she will utilize them, while Della sells her hair to buy a present for Jim. Neither of them expects the other to go to such lengths. The irony here is effective on both a practical and a deeper, emotive level (Zafarovna). Della and Jim both purchase each other a gift that turns out to be financially foolish. They cannot spend money on stuff they won’t use since they’re impoverished. They do, however, receive something they did not expect: a present that reminds them of how much they love one other and are prepared to go to great lengths to make each other happy (Zafarovna). They offered each other the most powerful statement of their love they could muster.
One of Poe’s shortest stories, “The Tell-Tale Heart,” deals with paranoia and mental disintegration. While in “The Gifts of Magi” the aspect of mental illnesses is omitted, more focusing on the general assumptions of hardships of living being impoverished, Poe, as in most of his stories, delves into deeps of human mentality. In this story, Poe delves into a psychological mystery: why individuals damage those they love or need in their life (Bloom). Po, the narrator, adores the elderly gentleman. He is not envious of the elderly man’s fortune (he, himself, is impoverished), nor is he vengeful about minor matters. In this approach, the narrator removes potential reasons for a crime (Alsahafi). The narrator, claiming his own sanity, is fixated on the old man’s vulture look. In the end, the narrator further dehumanizes the elderly man by murdering him and dismembering his victim. The narrator validates his theory that the old man’s eye is distinct from him by fully killing him and dividing him into several bits (Poe). The protagonist, on the other hand, ironically confesses to the crime when the police turn up. Poe’s stories are known for literally bringing the dead back to life by utilizing memory as a trigger to bring them back to life (Alsahafi). He identifies the bothering sound as the old man’s heart beating beneath the floorboards, which completely ruins his mental health.
To make their stories more interesting for readers, O. Henry and Poe employed suspense, irony, or both. Irony has become a common thread running through both works, making them very similar in this aspect of their use of literary devices. Both O. Henry and Poe became well known for the twist endings, an unexpected outcome leading to a reassessment of the initial positions of their characters. However, the aspects of irony explored by authors are completely different. In “The Gifts of the Magi,” the irony brings the story to somewhat of a happy end. The ironic outcome of the gifts exchange serves as a bridge to the understanding of love, that is, sacrificing the most precious possessions (Sushma). Poe’s narrative is way darker in this regard, leading a reader not to expect the confession of a murderer, who is suddenly disturbed my ‘a heart pounding’.
Poe often employs dramatic irony, such as the narrator’s kindness to an elderly man a week before he murders him. The reader would not anticipate the narrator to be courteous to the elderly guy before killing him, therefore thus being a dramatic irony. Another ironic metaphor is situational, as the elderly gentleman keeps his windows securely shut due to his fear of intruders (Alsahafi). It is ironic since the narrator, who lives with him, is the only burglar near his house.
In both stories, the authors deal with impoverished protagonists who are going through a difficult time. This makes another point of comparison between stories. There are certain socioeconomic parallels between characters, and the environment is also nearly the same, namely, a modest flat. Moreover, both take place in the winter, one in January and the other at the turn of the century around Christmas time. The difference in socioeconomic conflicts, exaggerated by moral compasses, is still recognizable. Poe, in his usual manner, explores the insanity, leaving his protagonist with a moral imperative – he can not run away from your consciousness, no matter how finely did he cut it (and hid it) (Bloom). O’Henry built his narrative of slightly different construction, although also psychological – the connection between foolishness and socioeconomic conditions (Zafarovna). His protagonists sacrificed all they had for things they did not need, which theoretically can tear their lives apart.
“The Tell-Tale Heart” by Edgar Allen Poe and “The Gift of the Magi” by O. Henry is exemplary literature works that contributed to the development of modern literature. As it was discussed, both authors resorted to the use of irony and similar decorations while exploring ultimately different outcomes in their own fashion. O. Henry presented us the eternal story of unselfish love, not deprived of more complicated, behind-the-bars dilemmas. In his traditional suspenseful, gothic style, Poe drove his protagonist to the murder of the person he tacitly adored, though at the same time hated. The differences and similarities of both pieces signify the uniqueness of the authors’ writing style, points of view, and overall impression on the readers."

"The American War of Independence is between the American colonies and Great Britain. The revolution’s success eventually depended on the willingness of Americans to risk their lives and economic well-being in the name of patriotism. The revolution was a conservative attempt to preserve freedoms that seemed to be threatened by British politics. However, the war was accompanied by social and intellectual transformations that radically changed the nature of American politics and brought ordinary people into politics to an unprecedented degree. It was the main reason why the Patriots were willing to risk their lives for the sake of independence and change.
Firstly, the Patriots wanted the American colonies to gain independence from Great Britain as they wanted their own independent country. People in America felt they were being treated unfairly by the British (DiPucchio, 2020). They were taxed without voting or being represented by the British government. Soon, the first battles for freedom were heard throughout the colonies. The Patriots wanted freedom from British rule and fought for it.
Secondly, the American fighters for independence were more willing to sacrifice their lives because they wanted to defend universal ideals. Indeed, American intellectuals were greatly influenced by the ideas of John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who promoted the natural rights and freedoms of every man (The Library of Congress, n.d.). However, with its rigid class system and the unrestrained power of the monarchy, the British Empire was far from the new values that more and more Americans held.
Finally, the new generations of immigrants were forming a new identity that differed from those that their fathers had. They started associating themselves less with English, German, or Dutch and more with Americans (Hanson & O’Dwyer, 2019). Thus, the gap between people in England and its American colonies became wider, and the former was viewed as the conquerors by the latter. Therefore, the patriots were willing to risk their lives to ensure freedom from the oppressors.
Overall, it is argued that there are at least three reasons that made the patriots willing to sacrifice their lives in the war against the British Empire. Among them, the unfair treatment that Americans experienced as they were heavily taxed and could not influence the political situation is found to be one of the strongest ones. Additionally, the spread of modern ideas and a new identity formation in the colonies further increased this dissatisfaction."
"Transporting cremated remains to France from the United States involves several requirements and processes. This essay will discuss the necessary documents, the role of the French consulate in Los Angeles, and the transportation logistics involved in this somber task.
To begin with, there are certain documents that are crucial for the transportation of cremated remains. The primary document is the death certificate, which must be translated into French. It is advisable to obtain multiple copies of the translated death certificate to avoid any delays during the process. Additionally, a Cremation Authorization Form from the funeral home handling the remains is required, stating that the cremation process was legal and carried out appropriately. A certificate of cremation is also needed, indicating the identity of the deceased, the date and place of cremation, and the seal of the crematory.
Furthermore, it is necessary to obtain a Consular Mortuary Certificate issued by the French consulate. This certificate confirms that the cremated remains meet French import regulations. To obtain this certificate, one must submit the translated and certified death certificate, the translated cremation certificate, a copy of the passport or French ID of the sender, and a letter explaining the purpose of transportation. The French consulate in Los Angeles plays a key role in this process, as they review the documentation and issue the Consular Mortuary Certificate. Their assistance is essential in ensuring that the transportation is legally and procedurally sound.
When it comes to transportation logistics, the cremated remains can be transported as checked baggage or cargo. If transported as checked baggage, the remains must be accompanied by a copy of the death certificate, the Consular Mortuary Certificate, and any relevant permits or endorsements. The container holding the cremated remains should be securely packed to prevent any damage during transportation. However, it is important to note that each airline has its own policies and procedures regarding the transportation of human remains, so it is advisable to contact the specific airline to understand their requirements.
If the cremated remains are transported as cargo, it is necessary to engage the services of a licensed funeral home or a specialized cargo shipping company. These professionals have the expertise to handle the necessary paperwork, packaging, and transportation arrangements, ensuring compliance with international regulations and providing the necessary peace of mind during this delicate process.
In conclusion, transporting cremated remains to France from the United States involves fulfilling certain requirements and following a specific process. These include obtaining the necessary documents such as the translated death and cremation certificates, acquiring the Consular Mortuary Certificate from the French consulate in Los Angeles, and carefully arranging the logistics of transportation be it as checked baggage or cargo. While this process may seem complex and emotionally challenging, adhering to the requirements and seeking assistance from professionals ensures a respectful and smooth journey for the departed loved one."
"According to Lufkin (2021), there is an urgent need to reduce the impact on physical and digital presenteeism in the era of pandemic and social transformations. This article focuses on the importance of recognizing true motives for presenteeism and defines the impact of subconscious biases on employee relationships. At the same time, the mere exposure and halo effects are associated with unfair or ineffective promotions that determine the quality of work. The idea that many biases unreasonably support presenteeism and negatively contribute to performance is correct, and differentiating employees’ achievements using favors seems questionable.
Presenteeism is problematic because most people continue addressing their subconscious beliefs about professional growth. Lufkin (2021) notices that not all employees can come to work early and leave late to demonstrate their devotion to the organization. Some people set priorities instead of achieving work-life balance and succeeding as an employee and a parent. They believe that their presence at the workplace helps get promotions or rewards, but the pandemic restrictions have already proved that remote work may be effective. Such attitudes towards presenteeism discourage and impose obligations that hardly improve performance.
However, the attention to the halo and mere exposure effects provokes some questions and concerns. The author admits that leaders and managers think about people who bring coffee or communicate as hard workers (Lufkin, 2021). In today’s business world, management principles have been improved, and employees get access to new practices at different levels. Good leaders will never promote a worker because of an improved ability to make coffee. If changes at the workplace are based on insignificant aspects, such organizations’ progress is questionable. For example, there are two sick individuals: one is present but does nothing because of a runny nose and a headache, and another is at home but works online to meet the deadline. An efficient manager analyzes the situation and understands the current contributions of both employees. If presenteeism fallaciously affects the attitude towards such employees, the team’s professionalism is low.
It is wrong to believe that showing faces at the office is a criterion for career growth. Lufkin’s article reveals concerns about presenteeism and its impact on people’s judgments. Sometimes, a person needs a break or a day off to work effectively, and absence is not a sign of unprofessionalism and weakness. Being present gives no guarantees about the quality of work, and this assessment makes companies competitive and strong."
"In the realm of sports, stadiums serve as grand arenas that showcase talent and provide an exhilarating experience for spectators. However, amidst all the excitement, incidents resulting in injuries and losses can occur, raising an important question of when a stadium can be held liable for such instances. To establish liability, substantial evidence must be provided, encompassing certain factors that contribute to the injuries or losses suffered by spectators.
One instance in which a stadium can be held responsible is when there is a failure to maintain a safe environment. Stadiums have the obligation to ensure that the premises are free from hazards that may cause harm to spectators. This includes regular maintenance of walkways, seating arrangements, and equipment. For instance, if a spectator slips on a wet and unmaintained stairwell, resulting in an injury, the stadium may be held liable for not exercising due diligence in providing a safe environment.
In addition, stadiums must take adequate measures to guarantee spectator safety by implementing proper security protocols. If a stadium fails to employ sufficient security personnel or adequately respond to potential threats, resulting in harm to spectators, liability can be established. For example, if a brawl breaks out in the stands due to the lack of security intervention, and a spectator is injured as a consequence, the stadium can be held liable for negligence.
To establish liability, the burden of proof lies with the injured party, who must provide convincing evidence that the stadium's actions or negligence led to the injuries or losses suffered. This may entail presenting witness testimonies, photographs, or videos showcasing the hazardous conditions or lack of security measures. Moreover, medical records, expert opinions, and even previous incidents occurring within the same venue can strengthen the case. The injured party must demonstrate a direct causal link between the stadium's actions or omissions and the suffered injuries or losses.
In conclusion, stadiums can be held liable for injuries and losses suffered by spectators in instances where the premises are not adequately maintained or when security measures are insufficient. The injured party must provide substantial evidence that establishes a direct causal link between the stadium's actions or negligence and the harm suffered. By prioritizing spectator safety and deploying comprehensive security measures, stadiums can greatly reduce the risk of liability and ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for all spectators."
"Introductory Paragraph:
Stress, focus, and segmental contrast in vowel durations play pivotal roles in shaping speech patterns and communication. This essay aims to explore the intricate relationship among these factors and analyze how they interact within the context of the English language. By examining stress patterns, focus, and vowel durations, we can gain insights into the complexities of spoken language, highlighting how stress and focus influence segmental contrasts in vowel durations.
Body:
1. Stress and Its Impact on Vowel Durations (200 words)
Stress is a fundamental aspect of the English language that affects both word and sentence levels. In stressed syllables, vowels tend to be longer and more prominent, while in unstressed syllables, they often become shorter and less prominent. This variation in vowel durations allows for enhanced perceptual contrasts between stressed and unstressed syllables, facilitating clarity and intelligibility during speech.
Research has demonstrated that stressed vowels exhibit longer durations due to increased muscular effort and vowel articulations. This phenomenon, known as vowel expansion, involves increased vowel space and improved perception. In contrast, unstressed vowels experience reduction in duration, impacting their acoustic properties and affecting the quality and intelligibility of weak syllables.
2. The Role of Focus and Its Influence on Vowel Durations (200 words)
Focus, often characterized by pitch accent or word prominence, represents the information deemed most salient within an utterance. It influences vowel durations by modulating the allocation of speaker's effort and attention. Vowel durations are usually extended in focused words or syllables to emphasize their significance and highlight the intended meaning.
The intelligibility of a focused element can be enhanced by elongating its vowel, creating a clear distinction between focused and non-focused elements. For instance, in sentences like ""She ATE an APPLE,"" the duration of the vowel in ""ATE"" might be longer to emphasize the eating action. This contrast in vowel durations enhances the listener's ability to identify important information.
3. Segmental Contrast and Its Interplay with Stress and Focus (200 words)
Segmental contrast refers to the differences in acoustic characteristics, including vowel durations, which allow listeners to differentiate one sound from another. Vowel duration is a crucial cue in establishing segmental contrasts, particularly in minimal pairs, where two words differ only in one vowel sound.
Stress and focus amplify segmental contrasts through the manipulation of vowel durations. Stressed syllables, which usually carry the primary stress in a word, exhibit longer durations compared to unstressed syllables. This contrast in vowel duration facilitates easier identification and differentiation of words, making it a vital element of spoken communication.
Additionally, focus accentuates the distinction between focused and non-focused elements, contributing to segmental contrasts. By prolonging the vowel duration in focused elements, speakers efficiently communicate their intentions, allowing their message to be accurately perceived by listeners.
Conclusion (50 words)
In conclusion, stress, focus, and segmental contrast in vowel durations are intricately interconnected processes that influence spoken language. Stress and focus serve as facilitators of segmental contrasts, shaping vowel durations to enhance clarity and intelligibility. Understanding this relationship is crucial for both linguists and language learners seeking to better comprehend the mechanics of spoken communication."
"Introduction
The revolution in cooking has resulted in a huge evolution of cooking techniques. Cooking has been practiced throughout history since ancient times. Previously, an ancient man consumed only raw food; nevertheless, once, a piece of flesh fell into the fire and was roasted (Harold 6). The man ate the portion and declared it delicious. Thus, the cooking process began and evolved. Cooking food is critical because it facilitates digestion, enhances the appearance, flavor, color, texture. In addition, cooking adds taste of the food diversity to the meal, thus the food stays fresher and lasts longer.
Cooking also requires an understanding of products and equipment and the ability to plan and organize meal preparation within time limits. Not to mention that traditional cooking techniques are more superior and healthier than newer ones such as microwave cooking (Harold 4). There are numerous cooking techniques such as boiling and steaming, the majority of which date back to ancient. Microwaving is a more recent innovation (Harold 784). Various methods employ varying degrees of heat and moisture and require varying amounts of time to cook. The method used significantly impacts the overall result, as certain foods are more suited to certain processes than others.
Cooking Techniques
Cooking is the art of preparing food for consumption, most typically by the use of heat. Cooking techniques and ingredients vary significantly across the globe, reflecting distinct climatic zones, economic conditions, cultural traditions, and trends (Harold 777). Cooking techniques also vary according to an individual’s skill level and type of training. Conduction, convection, and radiation all contribute to the transfer of heat to the food during cooking (Harold 782). The method of cooking is determined by the way heat is applied to the meal. Certain foods, such as leafy greens such as spinach and fenugreek, contain high moisture. These foods are prepared in a way that takes advantage of this moisture. However, rice, wheat, and pulses have a low moisture content; they are cooked with more water (moisture) (Mwale et al. 1056). There are additional methods of cooking that do not require any water; in fact, these methods assist the food to remain crisp after completion. As a result, cooking techniques are classed as either moist heat, dry heat, or frying.
Classification of Cooking Methods
Cooking by Moist Heat
Moist-heat cooking refers to cooking that uses watery substances as the primary cooking medium. The liquid is used for cooking food in moist heat (Bernhardt, Simone, and Elmar 328). The medium used during moist cooking include coconut cream, water or oil. Usually, the above liquids are included in cooked food or heated before the addition is done. Moist-heat cooking involves cooking at a lower temperature, often between 140 and 212 degrees Fahrenheit (which is, of course, the point at which water boils) (Lobefaro et al. 100381). In this research, we will discuss steaming, blanching, and boiling, as braising and poaching are often utilized for meat and fish preparation. This method includes submerging meals in boiling liquid or exposing them to steam to cook them. This highlights the food’s natural flavor and aroma. It is critical to understand the many forms of moist cooking to determine the most appropriate approach for a particular dish. Steaming, boiling, blanching, simmering, and poaching are all moist-heat cooking methods.
Cooking by Dry Heat
Dry heat cooking methods do not require the use of water to cook the meal. The meal is let to dry and then cooked using heat. In order for food to cook, it must either be heated in its juice or heated in a liquid that was added to it during cooking and evaporated, cooking the food. In fact, dry-heat cooking refers to any method of cooking that uses hot air, hot metal, a flame, or hot fat to transport heat to the meal without the need for moisture. Fat is an excellent medium for cooking on low heat (Mwale et al. 1056). At first, glance, because the fat in a deep fryer is liquid, it appears to be moist-heat cooking. Bear in mind that dry-heat cooking brown foods, whereas moist-heat cooking does not. As a result, it’s easy to see why fat is considered a dry-heat method, as dishes cooked in fat drippings turn golden and crispy when prepared correctly.
Broiling, baking, roasting, grilling, pan-broiling, griddling, sautéing, pan-frying, and deep-frying is examples of dry-heat cooking methods. The ideal meats for dry cooking are extremely soft, have little connective tissue, and be served medium-rare.
Moist Heat Cooking Techniques
Braising and Stewing
Searing or sautéing the food before partially covering it with liquid and simmering at a moderate temperature is the first step in braising. With braising, food cooks more evenly because heat is uniformly distributed throughout the pot, making it possible to cook it on the stovetop or in an oven (Mwale et al. 1056). Briskets from older animals or those with a larger percentage of connective tissue might benefit from being braise-cooked. The procedure is more widely utilized in current food preparation methods than in traditional ways. Braising technique is commonly used to cook modern foods as they require uniform distribution of heat.
Poaching
In poaching, food is immersed in a liquid such as wine, stock, or water and cooked at a low temperature. Poaching is distinguished from other “wet heat” cooking techniques, such as simmering and boiling, by its low temperature (about 160–180 °F (71–82 °C)) (Mwale et al. 1056). This temperature range is ideal for delicate foods like eggs, poultry, fish, and fruit, which can easily fall apart or dry out when cooked in other ways. Poaching is frequently seen as a healthy cooking method due to the absence of fat in the cooking and flavoring process (Roncero-Ramos et al. 294). Poaching is a simple way of cooking that requires no extra equipment and so saves fuel. Poached foods are easily digestible due to the absence of fat.
Simmering
Simmering is a cooking method in which food is cooked at temperatures between 180°F and 205°F. When a chef looks at the water, he or she will see bubbles forming and slowly rising to the top, but the water is not yet boiling over. Simmered food cooks pretty evenly since it is surrounded by water that keeps a reasonably constant temperature (Harold 784). It is the classic method for making stocks and soups, as well as starchy foods like potatoes or pasta dishes. The downside of simmering is that it leaches vitamins and other nutrients from the food into the cooking liquid. It is a fantastic choice for a variety of culinary preparations, including as stocks or soups, starchy things like potatoes or pasta, and many more. One disadvantage of this method of cooking is that it might lead the food to lose vitamins due to high temperatures of cooking involved.
Steaming
Steaming is a cooking method that involves exposing food to steam in a pressured steam cooker or heating it in a securely covered pan or other container. When cooking delicate foods like veggies, steaming is best. The cover of the pan traps the steam, creating a hot, moist atmosphere in which the food may cook. Steaming is not only wonderful for light meals like steamed pieces of bread, but it also helps maintain nutrients. When water is heated over 212°F, it ceases to be water and becomes steam (Harold 785). Steaming is quite gentle in physical agitation, making it perfect for preparing shellfish and other delicate things.
Additionally, it offers the significance of cooking faster while reducing nutrient loss that may be caused by high temperature ranges. Interestingly, like water, steam has a maximum temperature of 212°F (Roncero-Ramos et al. 290). Unlike water, however, steam can be compelled to surpass this natural temperature limit through the use of pressurization (Harold 786). When the pressure is increased, the steam grows hotter with time. However, since cooking with pressured steam needs specialized equipment, the ordinary home chef would not use it. The steps involved in steaming include:
  * In the bottom section of a steamer, let the water boil.
  * Arrange veggies in a steamer or perforated pan large enough to fit on top of a double boiler.
  * Lid and steam until the vegetables are soft. Leave the lid slightly ajar if the vegetables are green to help keep their color.
Dry heat cooking method
Roasting and Baking
While roasting is comparable to baking, the technique is more commonly associated with meat and poultry. Roasting food is usually doused in oil or other fluids to prevent it from drying out during cooking as opposed to baking. Roasting and baking are virtually synonymous. Both terms refer to a method of cooking an item by surrounding it in hot, dry air, typically inside an oven at temperatures of at least 300°F (but often much hotter) (Harold 784). This method cooks food pretty evenly, as all of the food’s surfaces are exposed to approximately the same amount of heat. This is in contrast to pan-searing, in which the surface that comes into contact with the hot pan becomes significantly hotter than the side that faces up.
Both roasting and baking require that the food is cooked uncovered so that the heat is provided by hot, dry air rather than steam from the food. Despite these similarities, roasting and baking might signify slightly different things to different people (Lobefaro et al. 100381). Certain chefs reserve the term “baking” for bread, pastry, and other bakery dishes. Some people use the phrase “roasting” exclusively to refer to meats, poultry, and vegetables, but “baking” refers to fish and other seafood (Harold 784). Another contrast is possible in terms of temperature, with “roasting,” meaning increased heat and thus a more rapid and dramatic browning.
Broiling and Grilling
Broiling is a way of cooking that is very similar to grilling but is done in the oven. Broiling is the process of bringing food very close to an intense heat source to cook it quickly at a high temperature. Broiling is another type of dry-heat cooking that relies on heat conduction via the air (Harold 783). Broiling, similar to grilling, can also be done in the oven as a low-fat, direct-heat cooking method. Due to the fact that air is a poor conductor of heat, broiling and grilling require the food to be extremely close to the heat source, which is most frequently an open flame. Grilling is a quick and healthful form of cooking that preserves vitamins and minerals. As a result, the food’s surface cooks quickly, making this cooking method suitable for chicken, fish, and tender pieces of meat.
Essentially, because this way of cooking is exceedingly hot and dry, it is normal to marinade foods that will be broiled or grilled. Usually, there is one crucial difference between broiling and grilling: grilling entails heating the meal below, and broiling requires heating the food from above (Harold 783). In both circumstances, the food is normally flipped once while cooking, and a grid or grate of some form is utilized to impart the distinctive grill marks characteristic of this cooking method. As with sautéing, preheating the broiler or grill prior to placing the food on it is crucial.
Deep-Frying
Another common form of cooking is the deep-fat frying technique. As strange as it may sound, deep frying is not a moist-heat approach but a dry-heat method. The temperature difference between deep frying and boiling is significant. Boiling water temperatures must never exceed 100C (212F), although deep frying temps can reach 200C. (400F) (Harold 784). These high temperatures enable the product to cook more quickly and to brown. Because deep-frying entails completely immersing the meal in hot, liquid oil, it may take some time to adjust to the fact that it is essentially a sort of dry-heat cooking (Harold 786). However, if one has ever witnessed the dramatic reaction of heated oil to even a tiny drop of water, they know that oil and water are opposed. The chef should ensure that anything they set in the hot fat is completely dry to avoid this. This may require patting an object dry with a paper towel prior to cooking.
Deep-frying needs maintaining an oil temperature of 325°F to 400°F. If the oil gets any hotter than that, it may begin to smoke, and if it gets any cooler, it begins to seep into the food, causing it to get greasy. Deep-fried products should have very little oil on them after cooking, providing they were cooked properly (Harold 786). The trick to maintaining a hot oil temperature is to fry stuff in tiny batches, as adding too much food to the oil can cause it to cool. Another indicator that deep-frying is a sort of dry-heat cooking is the delicious golden-brown hue of items prepared this way. Frequently, foods are covered in a basic batter to protect them and retain their moisture.
Pan-frying
Pan-frying is a cooking technique that involves cooking food in an uncovered pan with a small amount of fat. It is comparable to sautéing but requires more fat and frequently lower heat. Pan-frying is a quick and easy cooking method comparable to frying but without the fat; it is sometimes referred to as sautéing (Harold 786). To achieve the greatest results, choose beef cuts that are 3/8′′ to 1/2′′ thick. Season the meat with salt and pepper while heating a skillet to medium-high heat for a 1/2-inch thick or less cut. Cook the meat in batches, flipping occasionally, but do not cover the skillet during the cooking process.
As a cooking method, pan-frying relies on oil/fat as a heat transfer medium and on the proper temperature and timing to avoid overcooking or burning the food. Pan-frying can help preserve the moisture in meals like meats, fish, and seafood (Harold 786). Due to the partial covers, food is usually flipped at least once to guarantee even cooking on both sides. A pan-fry cooks lower than a sauté (Bernhardt, Simone, and Elmar 330). This is because the food to be pan-fried is not sliced into little pieces before cooking, such as chicken breasts, steak, pork chops, or fish fillets. Pan-frying demands a lower heat to prevent the exterior of the dish from overcooking before the interior reaches the right temperature, and it can help retain moisture in foods (Harold 786). The same amount of oil as in a sauté – just enough to coat the pan – is used in a pan fry, but the temperature should be reduced. The oil should constantly be heated enough to allow steam to escape from the food. Steam’s power prevents the oil from soaking into the meal.
Conclusion
In conclusion, there are various cooking techniques categorized as either moist cooking or dry cooking techniques. In a review, the paper has demonstrated that moist cooking techniques include steaming, boiling, blanching, simmering, and poaching. Moist-heat cooking involves cooking at a lower temperature, often between 140 and 212 degrees Fahrenheit (which is, of course, the point at which water boils). On the other hand, dry cooking techniques entail broiling, baking, roasting, grilling, pan-broiling, griddling, sautéing, pan-frying, and deep-frying are all examples of dry-heat cooking methods. The ideal meats for dry cooking are extremely soft, have little connective tissue, and be served medium-rare."
"Health promotion models serve as a framework to guide early childhood wellness programs in rural communities. One such model is the socio-ecological model, which acknowledges that individual health is influenced by multiple levels: individual, interpersonal, community, and societal. When designing programs, it is crucial to consider these levels of influence and implement interventions that address each level. For instance, at the individual level, wellness programs can focus on early education to promote healthy behaviors such as proper nutrition, regular exercise, and good hygiene. At the community level, interventions can involve partnerships with local organizations and institutions to provide access to nutritious foods, safe play spaces, and quality healthcare services.
Early exposure to harmful events has a profound impact on a child's health habits, making it imperative to address these issues in early childhood wellness programs. Rural communities often face specific challenges such as limited access to healthcare, higher rates of poverty, and environmental hazards. All of these factors contribute to increased exposure to adverse events, including food insecurity, substance abuse, and domestic violence. Early childhood wellness programs must address the consequences of these events by providing counseling services, trauma-informed care, and support groups for children and their families. By doing so, these programs help mitigate the potential long-term impacts of adverse events, promote resilience, and foster healthy coping mechanisms.
Cultural competencies are essential when implementing early childhood wellness programs in rural communities. Cultural competence refers to the ability to understand, appreciate, and effectively interact with people from different cultural backgrounds. In rural areas, cultural diversity may exist within a community as well as between communities. To ensure the effectiveness of wellness programs, it is crucial to take into account the unique cultural beliefs, practices, and preferences of the community. This can be achieved by engaging community members in program planning and implementation, employing bilingual staff, and incorporating culturally relevant resources and materials. By adopting a culturally competent approach, early childhood wellness programs can be sensitive to the diverse needs and values of rural communities, thereby increasing their impact and acceptance.
In conclusion, early childhood wellness programs in rural communities are a vital component of addressing the health and well-being of children. By incorporating health promotion models, acknowledging the impact of early exposure to harmful events, and considering cultural competencies, these programs can effectively promote healthy habits, mitigate the consequences of adverse events, and ensure the inclusion of all community members. Implementing these programs strategically in rural areas will help bridge the gap in healthcare access and provide children with the necessary foundation for a healthy and thriving future."

"My 73-year-old dad pulls his decaying teeth out himself because he cannot afford to go to the dentist and get them taken out professionally. He is embarrassed to smile, suffers from pain, and cannot chew properly. Terrible to imagine that it will only worsen and doubtfully get better. Unfortunately, my dad is not alone: dental issues are common among seniors. Mouth pain is a sign of deep cavities infecting blood vessels and nerves in the teeth. In 2020, more than 40% of adults reported having experienced pain in their mouth. Lack of dental care coverage, affordability, and accessibility for seniors is an extremely disturbing topic, and despite being highlighted and discussed on the governmental level, no solutions are implemented.
Inconceivably, a governmental insurance program is not framed to support seniors suffering from dental issues. Since its formation in 1965, Medicare has omitted routine dental care, preventive dental services, and restorative dental procedures coverage. Medicare doesn’t include dental care coverage, and expenses coverage is limited. Costs related to dental treatment are incredible: millions of dollars are currently being spent on oral health complications in the emergency room, and the vast majority of such patients are seniors. The Kaiser Family Foundation conducted a study in 2019 and reported that 65%, almost two-thirds, of all Medicare beneficiaries didn’t have any dental coverage. The Journal of the American Medical Association also reported that during 2017, about 70% of seniors had trouble with their teeth and could not eat properly, still did not visit the dentist. The same report indicated that almost half of the aged Americans claimed that the primary cause of avoiding an appointment with a dentist is the cost.
A recent American College of Emergency Physicians report indicates that America experiences over 151 million emergency department visits every year. 96% of non-traumatic dental emergencies result from abscesses and caries. Many emergency department visits arise from individuals who do not have access to dental care providers or cannot afford a primary dentist.
One of the significant recent legislative efforts for dental services to be included in Medicare is the proposed Medicare expansion by President Biden. The proposal includes including dental, hearing, and vision coverages to Medicare. Although both Republicans and Democrats supported the proposal, republicans seemed reluctant since they predicted it would increase the costs to be incurred. Thus, individuals want the dental coverage to be included in Medicare but don’t want to be the ones to pay for it. The most significant problem is that there has not been notable progress in the proposal; hence the nation doesn’t know when or if the proposal will be implemented.
Dental coverage for Medicare beneficiaries is essential not just for oral health but also for overall health. Dental care inaccessibility is an acute issue that requires attention and urgent solutions. One in ten dental care beneficiaries currently spends more than $2,000 out of pocket, while one in five spends more than $1,000. The spending costs are likely to grow as the population ages, and the oral health of aged individuals will decline even further. Several studies indicate substantial barriers for older adults in obtaining dental services, including the high costs. There is a dire need to invest in the dental Medicaid program to not burden seniors with paying for it.
Dentist coverage aside, Medicare has been waiting to be expanded since Medicare beneficiaries spend about 39% of their out-of-pocket health expenditures on services Medicare does not cover. Since many individuals don’t have supplemental insurances to cover the extra services, they use their pocket money to pay for them. Around half the states don’t offer denture coverage but only provide emergency dental care. It is important to note that coverage does not guarantee access. For example, only a few participants currently take part due to the low Medicaid payment rate. Expanding Medicaid on service coverage could solve cost barriers and unmet needs facing low-income Medicare beneficiaries. The more the expansion of Medicaid to reach all poverty levels, the more challenging it would be to the current environment.
In conclusion, I think that if we don’t commit ourselves to solving these issues, our aging population will undoubtedly be visiting the emergency room more often, and we all will be paying more for it. I don’t know when or if my dad will ever get the benefit of getting to a dentist to fix his aching teeth. Our older generation does not deserve to suffer from mouth pain, and policy changes should be considered as fast as possible."

"The cultural effects of Roman dominance over the Greek-speaking regions is a fascinating topic that has attracted great scientific interest, especially in the last couple of years. The impact of the interaction between two cultures varied in time and space and was definitely more prominent in places where Roman communities had emerged. These communities served as the so-called influence vectors, and their long residing alongside Greeks resulted in the transmission of Roman elements into public life.
One of such elements was Roman names, the dissemination of which may be explained by the existence of networks of exchange and the sense of identity of name bearers. Rizakis (2019) notes that the introduction of the Greeks to the Roman system of naming with its further adaptation to their norms and the Roman names adoption by peregrine Greeks are two different phenomena. However, they both are examples of the interaction process between the two traditions, which gradually led to the appearance of a common onomastic culture. This acculturation form, increased in the 2 nd century AD, showed wide regional variability, and the reception of it was different in different cities and social classes.
These cultural transfers were mostly mediated by civic elites, as their purpose was to pass on their influence by name – both in a regional context and more broadly, on a system level. Tria nomina, in particular, and its use in the imperial period especially, as stated by Rizakis (2019), was a source of pride, power, and prestige. Due to this, some names became popular as expressions of the shared culture and were accepted and adopted, albeit on a small scale, by the lower classes as well, having lost their original meaning.
However, the dominance of Roman names as the distinguishing signs of the Empire’s free citizens took place for a short amount of time. As per Rizakis (2019), by the end of the 3 rd century AD, a new way of identity expression appeared – a single naming system using separate Greek and Roman names. At first it was used sparingly but after the reign of Constantine – and especially during the period of late antiquity – it started being employed in almost all Roman provinces. This change, advanced by Christianity’s progress and the Roman Empire’s decline, might be deemed as a return to the Greek naming tradition."
"The role of mass media in shaping public opinion and personal worldview on racial appearance cannot be underestimated. Through its various channels, media has the power to influence how individuals perceive and understand different races. Unfortunately, media's limited presentation and biased portrayal often lead to the formation of opinions and ideas that may perpetuate stereotypes about other races.
First and foremost, mainstream media has a significant impact on shaping public opinion on racial appearance. Television shows, movies, and advertisements often feature a narrow range of racial representation, primarily focusing on certain races while neglecting others. This limited presentation can lead individuals to believe that these representations are the norm, and other races are somehow less deserving of visibility. For instance, the underrepresentation of minorities in leading roles in Hollywood films sends a message that individuals from certain racial backgrounds are not as capable or important, perpetuating biased views and stereotypes.
Moreover, media's biased portrayal of certain races further exacerbates the problem. Sensationalized news stories, for example, often focus on crime or other negative aspects associated with marginalized racial groups. This biased coverage reinforces preconceived notions and stereotypes, leading to misunderstandings and discrimination. Numerous studies have shown that repetitive exposure to negative images and narratives can contribute to the formation of prejudiced attitudes towards those races, ultimately influencing personal worldviews.
The impact of media's limited presentation and biased portrayal can be especially detrimental when it comes to the formation of opinions and ideas about other races. Individuals who have limited exposure to racially diverse communities or lack personal interactions with people from different backgrounds often rely heavily on media for their understanding of different races. When media predominantly presents these races in a negative light or perpetuates stereotypes, it becomes difficult for individuals to form unbiased opinions. This can lead to the internalization of harmful stereotypes and contribute to the perpetuation of systemic racism.
In conclusion, the role of mass media in shaping public opinion and personal worldview on racial appearance is vast. Media's limited presentation and biased portrayal have a significant impact on the formation of opinions and ideas about other races. It is crucial for media outlets to recognize their responsibility and strive for more diverse and accurate representation. Similarly, consumers of media must actively seek out diverse perspectives and engage in critical thinking to combat the negative influence of media on racial appearance. By addressing these issues, we can collectively work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive society."
"Janina’s language in the novel Drive Your Plow over the Bones of the Dead is unique in many ways, as she unravels the mystery surrounding not only the murders but her personality. However, one of the most notable traits that the reader may notice on the first page is Janina’s use of nicknames as substitutes for any person or animal’s name. While many people use nicknames for friends or people they dislike, Janina’s approach is built on her feelings towards her name and names in general. She states, “I believe each of us sees the other person in our way, so we should give them the name we consider suitable.” She considers names “polyonymous” and adheres to this rule for every character she encounters.
As a result, each person that Janina talks with or about is transformed into the characteristic she sees in them. Her friend is Oddball – and from the beginning, the reader has to inherently accept that this person may be strange somehow, although it may not be accurate. Similarly, the murder victims – Big Foot, Commandant, Inner – have to be seen as the traits of appearance or status they have in Janina’s eyes. In contrast, when Janina thinks about a name for a rescue dog, her first idea is a human name, Marysia. She denies other pet names, saying that “considering her personal history” they could not be suitable for the dog. Thus, Janina thinks deeply about the animal’s life and problems, basing the name on the dog’s condition and story.
By looking at the contrast between names and nicknames that Janina uses for people and animals, one can see her actual values. She loves animals while humans get judged or excluded for their oddity. Therefore, while the narrator is untrustworthy, she quickly gives away her views on the murders and exposes her potential role in them. Her nature is to judge people for their treatment of animals, and the latter is perceived as better, more worthy of saving than humans."
"Financial statement analysis tools encompass ratio, vertical, and horizontal analysis. Therefore, this section will seek to explore the pros and cons of the mentioned financial analysis tools. Ratio analysis helps in the determination of efficiency in operations and in analyzing the financial budget of the organization. However, the ratio analysis tool is useful only when the competitor organization is of the same size and type. Similarly, it ignores the current and future data trends and focuses on past data hence, not an effective analysis tool. The vertical financial analysis tool provides an easier way to compare financial statements within an organization as well as between different organizations. Nevertheless, the vertical analysis tool does not measure the liquidity of the organization.
The horizontal analysis tool allows for easy interpretation of organizations’ comprehensive information as well as monitoring growth and financial patterns. Nevertheless, horizontal analysis is seen as inconsistent due to ever-changing accounting principles and factors. Financial statement analysis facilitates the financial plans and management of an organization by reviewing the cash flows, liability, business trends, and budget preparation. Different financial statement analysis methods are utilized in an attempt to obtain organizational data and information regarding the assets, liabilities, profits garnered, losses incurred, growth, and competition patterns."

"This question has a hypothesis that answers and figures out the components of matter, the essential element of all materials and objects on earth. For instance, it leads to understanding water’s nature and behaviour elements as oxygen and hydrogen.
This scientific question describes the different origins and nature of the materials that make the world look the way it looks today. The constituents of matter, such as water, break down to oxygen (the gas which supports burning) and hydrogen (the flammable gas) (BBC. 3). In this case, it can be argued that this scientific question plays an essential role in conducting experiments and creating inventions that have played a vital role in promoting humanity.
The world has developed and reached it through notable scientists and inventions who worked tirelessly to understand the world and nature. Indeed, they played an essential role in going deeper and acquiring knowledge that others at their time could never contemplate. Through their sacrifice, hard work and learning, and quest to know more, they were able to achieve inventions that, up to date, have been developed by their successors to create a better world in which human beings are living today.
This scientific question is vital in trying to identify what powers humanity. Indeed, human beings’ development and inventions depend on energy. This energy is essential in powering life and enabling people to live comfortably (BBC. 1). This quest led to the creation of chariots used to carry amour and soldiers along the coast. The same pursuit led to the integration of mathematicians and created more effective windmills, which would drain marshes and an entire lake.
Human beings are wired to demand more even when they have enough. The quest for a better life and earning prestige are the most critical drivers who have played a vital role in propelling humanity towards inventions. Competition and the drive of power and prestige among human beings have been crucial elements in propelling innovations and development to create a new and better life to appear different from others.
Human beings have always desired to have a better life. People have always desired to have prestige and have a better life when compared to others. Successive scientific inventions and the development of old technology have played a vital role in transforming the world to its current economic, social, and political success (BBC, 2). However, noble people and successful, wealthy business people had the desire. They funded scientific experiments to invest the technology in their territories and businesses to benefit from it.
This scientific question was vital in understanding earth with its relations to the universe. Indeed, the hypothesis of this question was a key driver in understanding earth and connecting it to the universe so that the world would be developed with effectiveness and efficiency. Indeed, the experiment that started in ancient Greece was a key stepping stone in understanding the world and its relation to the solar system."
"Introduction (approx. 80 words):
The United States' military engagement in the Middle East is a subject of intense debate and analysis concerning its impact on global peace and security. While proponents argue that the US presence is vital for maintaining stability and deterring threats, detractors question its effectiveness, consequences, and the potential for escalating conflicts. This essay aims to critically examine the extent to which the US military presence in the Middle East is necessary for global peace and security.
Body Paragraph 1 – Counterterrorism Efforts (approx. 100 words):
One compelling argument for the necessity of the US military presence in the Middle East is its role in counterterrorism efforts. The region has been a breeding ground for extremist groups, and the US presence can aid in disrupting their operations, dismantling their networks, and preventing attacks both within the region and globally. Past successes, such as the elimination of high-profile terrorists and the degradation of their capabilities, suggest that the US military presence has contributed to reducing the immediate threat posed by extremist organizations.
Body Paragraph 2 – Regional Stability and Deterrence (approx. 120 words):
Another aspect of the US military presence in the Middle East is its role in maintaining regional stability and deterring aggression. The Middle East is rife with complex geopolitical conflicts, and the US presence acts as a stabilizing force by dissuading potential aggressors. For instance, the presence of US troops in key countries like Saudi Arabia can deter external attacks and serve as a deterrent against regional conflicts, preventing the outbreak of major wars that would have far-reaching global implications.
Body Paragraph 3 – Backlash and Escalation Risks (approx. 100 words):
However, the US military presence also presents risks that can undermine global peace and security. The perception of occupation and intervention can fuel anti-American sentiment, creating a fertile ground for recruitment by extremist groups. Moreover, military operations, even with the noble objective of peacekeeping, can inadvertently harm civilians, further exacerbating hostility towards the United States. The unintended consequences of military campaigns and the potential for public backlash undermine the overall effectiveness of the US presence in promoting long-term peace and stability.
Conclusion (approx. 100 words):
In conclusion, the United States' military presence in the Middle East plays a complex and multifaceted role in global peace and security. While serving as a counterterrorism tool and a deterrent against aggression, it also carries risks of backlash and escalation. The United States must continually weigh the benefits against the potential drawbacks and seek to minimize harm while maximizing the effectiveness of its actions. Furthermore, promoting diplomatic solutions, investing in regional stability, and collaborating with international partners should also be an integral part of any comprehensive global peace and security strategy, gradually reducing the need for military presence in the long term."
"Introduction
Intel Corporation (Intel) is a semiconductor computer circuits manufacturer based in the United States. Intel, also known as “Integrated electronics,”- the company’s name, is headquartered in Santa Clara, California. The company operates through segments such as The Internet of Things Group (IOTG) and Mobileye (Hall, 2021). It sells platform goods, including chipsets and the central processor units and system-on-a-chip and multichip packages.

It also provides platforms that optimized workload and related solutions to cloud service providers, business and government customers, and communications service providers. Cloud services providers, original design, and equipment manufacturers are all served by the firm. Intel Corporation has formed a strategic agreement to utilize and develop artificial intelligence approaches for improving drug discovery. The paper describes the Supply Chain ESG as how Intel corporation creates a positive impact on the global environment.
Intel Code of Conduct (COC)
The Code of Conduct establishes the company’s standards for how it coordinates its activities to create and deliver products, protects the value of Intel and its subsidiaries, and interacts with customers, suppliers, and distributors. When performing Intel-related business, it is the obligation of every individual at Intel to follow the code, the employment guidelines, and other applicable regulations. The company does business with unwavering ethical standards and honesty, treating distributors, suppliers, customers, fairness, respect, and honesty in all business interactions.
Intel and its subsidiaries require all employees to comply fully with internal investigations, comprising the provision of truthful information, except where the act would result in disclosing the participation of the in concerted activity under the National Labor Relations Act of the United States. Staff who fail to do so may face disciplinary action, comprising termination, depending on the applicable local legislation (Hall, 2021). Employee involvement in inquiries into suspected violations of the United States National Labor Relations Act is voluntary, albeit encouraged.
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
Intel’s dedication to sustainability leadership and corporate responsibility is firmly ingrained in the company’s culture. The company does not create an encompassing and positive work environment where every staff feels like they have a sense of belonging and a voice. Still, it is also proactive in its initiatives to minimize its environmental impact by using natural materials and resources efficiently and responsibly. The company also wants to use its leading position in the global digital ecosystem to assist the industry and company in achieving more progress in corporate responsibility, including governance, social impact, and environmental sustainability. Intel’s 2030 “RISE” strategy aims to utilize the company’s leading position in the global technology ecosystem to build a more inclusive, sustainable, and responsible society, powered by technology and employees’ skills and enthusiasm (Ganusov, Iyer, Cheng, & Meisler, 2020). It aims to double the number of females and the minority groups underrepresented in higher employment ranks over the following decade.
Supply chain responsibility
Effectively controlling and enhancing performance throughout the company’s supply chain lowers risks, enhances product quality, and aids the staff in meeting the social and environmental objectives of the company. This adds value to the business and its consumers. Intel has several rigorous initiatives to educate and educate the suppliers that support the company’s worldwide manufacturing activities to guarantee that the supply chain is accountable, respectful of human rights, and resilient.
The company’s accelerating responsible standards and accountability across sectors via leadership and partnership with suppliers. Intel’s worldwide strategy of supply chain aims to establish a responsible, robust, and varied supply chain that allows customers to generate data-driven technological solutions, suppliers, stakeholders, consortia, and fellow travelers (Bowersox, 2019). Intel functions with approximately 9,000 tier-one suppliers in 89 states to deliver direct production materials, intellectual property, manufacturing equipment, machinery, delivery, and travel services, packing services, office supplies, and software (Ganusov et al., 2020). Other companies produce, assemble, and test some of the corporation’s products and components.
Environmental Sustainability
Intel has developed technology critical to tackling the world’s sustainability issues. The business is always looking for innovative methods to improve energy management and reduce emissions, including conservation, efficient building design, renewable energy, and other initiatives (Bowersox, 2019). The company considers key issues such as smart energy efficiency regulations, policies geared towards managing chemicals, and climate change solutions.
Chemical Management Policies
Chemicals are critical to semiconductor industry innovation. Intel is dedicated to chemical management that protects its employees and the environment. The company’s chemical policy is in line with the protection of the environment, chemical safety, and technological innovation in the United States. Advances in chemistry and materials science enable Intel’s technical innovation. Intel’s manufacturing competitiveness depends on the chemical suppliers’ ability to get novel chemicals authorized quickly, assure the continuity of supply of current chemicals, and safeguard their intellectual property.
Solutions to Enable Climate Change
Information and communications technology (ICT) devices powered by Intel silicon chips can help drive end-use energy efficiency advancements, resulting in considerable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The company’s technology enables others to lessen their footprint, which the firm refers to as the effect of the “Handprint.” Government policy should acknowledge and encourage the ICT industry to play a larger role in developing climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.
Intel’s corporate responsibility goals comprise a total dependence on renewable energy and producing zero trash by 2030. According to the company reports, many of the corporation’s 2020 goals were also met. It recycles over 90% of its garbage and sends virtually no hazardous material to landfills. According to the Intel code of conduct report (2021), the quantity of greenhouse gases it emits has decreased by around 30% since 2010. Yet, yearly emissions have increased somewhat since 2016 as the company has grown. According to the business, it reduced its water use by 38%, saving 44 billion gallons over the last decade (Intel code of conduct report, 2021). It will be a larger struggle to reduce those emissions, which Intel claims it is doing by attempting to make its devices more energy efficient.

"Influence on Jazz History
Charles Bolden was born in New Orleans and is recognized as the first person to perform and play what could thereafter be considered jazz music. Many early jazz musicians credited Charles as the founder of jazz. Louis Armstrong and Jelly Roll Morton attested that Bolden was among the most influential musicians who played jazz. Many aspects of Bolden traditions, such as syncopation, polyrhythm, and improvision, linger today and are considered significant to jazz music (Nmaam, 2019). Since Buddy Bolden’s band did not know how to read music, most of their compositions were either copied or generated on the spot. That is how the art of improvising became the hallmark of jazz. This style had an impact on young jazz musicians. Musicians today draw inspiration from the first king of jazz, and his influence on music culture and ingenuity touches them fundamentally.
Bolden was known for his loud sound. People who sang about the prowess of his music career emphasized his loudness. He cemented his reputation by using the knowledge of his cornet to put fans into a trance and get them dancing into a frenzy (Micucci, 2019). Bolden had the ability to sink himself into a trance where nothing mattered but music. He played blues at medium tempos sprinkled with racy lyrics. By mixing gospel and blues inflections, he made a rhythmic feel that resulted in a unique sound that spread throughout New Orleans. His talent for altering rhythm, performance, and melody elements appealed to his fans and forever changed the music course.
Events and People That Shaped His Life and Career
Bolden began playing the cornet in his teenage years. Manuel Hall, a neighbor, taught him how to play the cornet. He also took lessons on the cornet and played at parades in parks, picnics, and union halls that dotted the neighborhood. Bolden later joined a New Orleans band led by Charles Galloway, where he displayed his musical talent and skills. Later, the young musician created his band that consisted of five members – the guitar, cornet, two clarinets, bass, trombone, and drums. They played a wide range of genres, including ragtime, blues, and waltzes. Although the band was musically untrained and short on techniques, he improvised embellishments.
Bolden was also motivated by the music that was performed in his hometown. Some of the sounds he heard comprised jubilant singing, spirituals, and shouts from his neighborhood. Creole and African American musicians who played a waltz, schottische, and quadrille influenced his views on music styles (Sandmel, 2019). He played and associated with other early jazz musicians like George Baquet, Sidney Bechet, and Peter Bocage, who contributed immensely to his career. Bolden absorbed the African American and Afro-Caribbean folk music styles back in the day. Brass bands that performed various secular and religious functions also helped shape Bolden’s life in music.
In 1902, he was shortlisted as a music artist in the city directory (Sandmel, 2019). By the end of 1890, Bolden had the most powerful band in New Orleans. Due to the expanded band following, the demand for his music grew, and he constantly performed while playing dances and parades all across town. Unfortunately, the pressures of performing constantly and alcohol consumption ended his career in 1906. His relationship with the band deteriorated as he became unreliable and eventually quit playing. Bolden made his last public performance during a parade on Labor Day 1906."

"The immigration stations of Ellis Island and Angel Island are sites with great historical significance. Until this day, these places keep stories of millions of immigrants that passed through the doors of the stations between 1880 and 1930. In this period, Ellis Island was the largest and the busiest immigration station for people coming to the USA, mostly from Europe. It was interesting for me to learn that many women were detained by the Ellis Island officials, as before World War II, women were not allowed to enter the country without men. It was also interesting to learn that since 1907 children under 16 were not allowed to enter the country without a parent. Those who arrived at Ellis Island alone were sent back to their home countries. People who did not pass medical inspection were also sent back home from the station.
It seems astonishing to me that the station officials managed to inspect so many immigrants daily. The photos and video footages that have been preserved in the archives of the station show that the number of people passing through was incredibly high. Another fact that seemed interesting to me is that the station officials could separate children from their parents if they did not believe that they were, in fact, related. For example, when Lucy Attarian recalls the day she and her family were passing the inspection at Ellis Island, the official did not believe that she was related to her parents. 1 Her hair and general appearance were different from theirs, and the official told them to leave without Lucy. However, when she started crying after them, he believed that she was their daughter. The officials were cautious because there were many orphans coming to the country with other people’s families.
Although the Angel Island Immigration Station was often referred to as the “Ellis Island” of the West, the conditions in these sites were very different, and so was the treatment of the arriving immigrants. This was due to the fact that people passing through the Angel Island station were mainly from China, and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 had introduced strict regulations for immigrants of Asian origin. Many of them had to face “detention, quarantine, interrogation, and even deportation”. 2 Detention barracks for men and women were overcrowded and unsanitary, which often caused diseases to spread.
The walls of the barracks are full of cravings, which are mostly Chinese poems. People expressed their fears, dreams, and hopes for the future in those poems, and this seems to me an extraordinary example of how art can raise a person’s hopes even in the darkest of times. For most people in the barracks, those were the darkest times: they lived in uncertainty and fear of deportation, separated from their families, not knowing when they were going to see their loved ones again. The Angel Island officials could only allow individuals with certain occupations and those with relatives in America to enter the country. To ensure that an immigrant was, in fact, related to some established Chinese nationals in the country, they had to be subjected to detailed interrogations. The things that the officials asked about were often unreasonably and excessively detailed and too specific even for family members to know about each other. The documents in which these family histories were stored and structured were called “Coaching Papers”. 3 This is where the term “Paper Sons and Daughters” comes from it was a name for those who managed to pass the extremely challenging interrogations, although their relation to the already established immigrants was fictitious."
"Unfortunately, middle-aged women may run a risk of pathologic menopause. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account what specific features may aggravate the problem. The author of the post under consideration suggests that their patient with obesity and predisposition to breast cancer should take Metoprolol instead of Norvasc to illuminate the symptoms of premature menopause. Also, it would be of help to keep a diet and give up smoking. Such recommendations are bound to be efficient because they fully correspond to the patient’s needs.
Admittedly, in case of menopause, a patient’s hormone levels and BMI are measured to find out whether there is a possibility of severe impairment. According to recent studies, “sex hormone levels after menopause are associated with women’s increased CVD risk later in life” (as cited in J Am Coll Cardiol, 2018, p. 2555–66). It sounds sensible that the patient under analysis should discontinue Norvasc intake because of its side effects, causing the risk of heart diseases in the long run because of reduced of motor activity. Being a beta-blocker, Metoprolol is sure to be an accurate decision for this particular case.
However, the patient’s obesity status is better to be reconsidered before prescribing an exact diet. Banack and their team of researchers conducted a research, the results of which “demonstrate that a BMI cut-point of 30 kg/m 2 does not appear to be an appropriate indicator of true obesity status in post-menopausal women” (Banack et al., 2018). It means that fast weight loss can be useless and even harmful. The same concerns HRT application as the patient has a cancer predisposition. Doctors claim that “although less effective than HRT, SSRIs/SNRIs are demonstrated to reduce hot flashes and may be recommended for women who wish to avoid the risks of HRT” (Stubbs et al., 2017). Thus, HRT is not to recommend because it is generally believed to increase the risk of cancer.
To sum it up, the author’s recommendations are likely to lead to a successful treatment of the symptoms of premature menopause. The suggestion to replace Norvasc with Metoprolol seems to be a reasonable decision. As far as HRT is concerned, it is of utmost importance to diminish the risk of cancer. That is why SSRIs/SNRIs may prove to be the right approach to hot flushes treatment. Still, the prescription of a diet should be reconsidered according to new data."
"Firstly, profit is often seen as the ultimate measure of success for businesses. It provides insight into whether a company's operations are generating a net income or a net loss. Profitability is not only essential for attracting investors but also for reinvesting profits into the business for expansion, debt repayment, or dividend distribution. However, profit alone does not guarantee long-term success as it neglects the timing and sustainability of cash flows.
Cash flow, on the other hand, reflects the actual inflows and outflows of cash, taking into consideration payment terms and collection intervals. It enables precise tracking of how money is moving in and out of a business, providing valuable information about a company's liquidity. A positive cash flow ensures a firm's ability to meet short-term obligations, such as salaries, rent, and supplier payments. By managing cash flow efficiently, businesses can avoid liquidity issues and maintain financial stability.
Incorporating innovation in operations requires careful cost consideration. Innovation often involves investment in research and development, technology, and new processes, which may incur significant expenses. Understanding the impact of these costs on profitability and cash flow is crucial. By accurately estimating expenses and weighing them against potential benefits, businesses can make informed decisions regarding innovation implementation.
Furthermore, cost consideration plays a role in determining the price points of innovative products or services. If expenses are not properly managed, innovations may become unaffordable for customers, hindering their adoption and revenue generation. By striking a balance between cost and market demand, businesses can successfully incorporate innovation into their operations while maintaining profitability and positive cash flows.
In conclusion, understanding both profit and cash flow is essential for businesses to effectively manage their financial health and make informed decisions. Profitability provides insights into a company's performance, while cash flow ensures liquidity and operational stability. Additionally, cost consideration plays a crucial role in incorporating innovation into operations by accurately estimating expenses, determining pricing, and balancing profitability with market demand. By considering these factors, businesses can navigate the dynamic competitive landscape and foster long-term success."
"The situation in Pioneering Technologies (PT) is complex and ethically unstable. On the one hand, Owl Vision is a unique product in the field of bionic eyes with clear strategies and benefits for customers. On the other hand, the causes of fall-off because of some changing conditions are poorly investigated. In other words, no guarantees are given to explain the shortages of the new product. Regarding such conditions, the utilitarian ethical framework must be applied as the most consistent option with PT’s corporate culture. The main idea of this approach is that morally right steps are those leading to the best outcomes for many people and resulting in the greatest overall good (Halbert & Ingulli, 2015). The company should analyze the harms and benefits of the campaign and the product not only in relation to its success but all stakeholders and users who may be affected by the decision (Halbert & Ingulli, 2015). The examples include the evaluation of long- and short-term outcomes. Many individuals can be attracted by the campaign at the beginning, but their problems and concerns would grow with time, challenging the company’s reputation.
Following the rules and principles of the utilitarian ethical framework, the identification of the outcomes plays an important role. When the company is confident in positive results and benefits for the company and ordinary users, the success of the campaign within the framework may be observed. Thus, at the moment, PT should not proceed with the advertising campaign as it is but must focus on some changes and improvements before introducing the product to customers. The main steps contain the analysis of the current position, the identification of shortages, and the discussion of the effects (Halbert & Ingulli, 2015). If the harms prevail over the benefits within some aspects, it is important to involve more people and clarify the defects with its solutions.
Considering the current state of affairs, the representatives of Eagle Eye Technology (EET) do not prefer to follow some ethical standards and have already got access to the PT’s concerns and challenges. They decide to stop the PT’s campaign and not to allow misleading the public. Therefore, the idea of whistleblowing is an appropriate mechanism for EET to follow. Whistleblowers are people who try to disclose information inside organizations to the media (Halbert & Ingulli, 2015). Their goal is to reveal a disturbing situation to light. However, in this case, it remains unclear if EET wants to bring some changes or to achieve some competitive advantage and defeat PT in this attempt. As a result, it is hard to say that EET could ultimately win. According to Halbert and Ingulli (2015), whistleblowing might wreak havoc in the industry and damage the reputations of both biotechnological organizations. The chosen mechanism does not presuppose the presence of a definite winner, but the number of losers may unpredictably grow.
Using a poor product and maintaining awareness of its threats provoke multiple risks for people. If PT gets a chance to launch Owl Vision and customers do not have enough information about failed performance due to weather changes, accidents, and other challenges. When a consumer is involved in a motor vehicle accident because of the poor performance of the Owl Vision product, it is possible to address product liability theory as a basis for a lawsuit. The citizen was not informed about the unsafe and dangerously defective product, and this unawareness makes it possible to use the product under unfavorable conditions, meaning cloudy weather (Halbert & Ingulli, 2015). Addressing the current common law of torts, the driver should expect compensations from PT if the problem with the Own Vision product is investigated and proved."
"Introduction (50 words):
Religious paintings, crafted to depict sacred narratives and spiritual themes, often employ perspective as a key artistic tool. This essay examines the role of perspective in religious artworks, exploring how it influences the viewer's understanding and interaction with the pieces. By analyzing renowned religious paintings from different perspectives, we can unravel the profound impact that perspective can exert on shaping religious experiences and connecting audiences to the divine.
Body:
1. Perspective as a Theological Device (100 words):
Religious paintings utilize perspective as a potent theological device that communicates spiritual concepts. The implementation of linear perspective, for instance, affords depth and dimension to the artwork, accentuating the immersion of the viewer. This immersion enables viewers to perceive the divine narrative and participate mentally and emotionally in the depicted events. Perspective empowers artists to create a visual representation that unfolds before the viewer, evoking a sense of awe and transcendence, and inviting them to connect more intimately with the divine.
2. Altering the Viewer's Spatial Perception (100 words):
Religious paintings artistically manipulate perspective, altering the viewer's spatial perception to depict the divine realm in a tangible and relatable manner. The strategic use of foreshortening, for example, brings celestial figures and sacred events closer to the human realm. By scaling divine figures to human proportions, painters transcend the earthly constraints of physical laws and manifest the divine amidst human surroundings. Such intentional distortion in perspective expands the viewer's understanding, making the divine realm accessible and facilitating a deeper connection with sacred themes.
3. Emotional Engagement and Connection (100 words):
Perspective serves as an emotional conduit, evoking profound empathy and connection between the viewer and religious art. By depicting key figures and moments from an intimate or subjective perspective, artists foster emotional resonance and encourage the audience to imaginatively place themselves within the scene. The implicit invitation to participate emotionally transforms the experience of viewing religious paintings into a personal encounter with the divine. This emotional engagement allows individuals to reflect on their own spiritual journeys and elicits an interpretive and empathetic understanding that transcends mere observation.
4. Cultural and Historical Context (100 words):
When considering religious paintings, perspective plays an additional role in mediating the viewer's understanding of the cultural and historical context in which the artwork was produced. The artist's choice of perspective reveals their worldview, incorporating societal norms and beliefs. Understanding this context is crucial when interpreting religious art, allowing viewers to appreciate the profound impact that perspective has on conveying religious doctrines, asserting theological beliefs, and expressing societal or political ideologies.
Conclusion (50 words):
In religious paintings, perspective functions as a dynamic and multifaceted tool that shapes the viewer's understanding and interaction with the artwork. By manipulating perception, religious painters facilitate a connection between the audience and the divine, fostering emotional engagement and enabling a personal encounter with the spiritual realm. Understanding the intricate interplay of perspective in religious paintings enriches our appreciation of these artistic masterpieces as potent vessels of faith and spirituality."
"Abstract
Due to the increasing complexity of making optimal business decisions, organizations require tools to understand current processes and act preemptively. This work articulates tools used in this process: analysis techniques applied to innovative solutions, cause-and-effect approach to risk evaluation, and strategies of investment decision analysis. The United Arab Emirates has been effective and successful in business decision analysis. This paper discusses instances in which well-executed decisions have highly improved organizational operations. The study will largely uncover crucial aspects and decision techniques while critically examining each of them to ascertain the workability of the techniques, especially within the UAE context.
Descriptive, Predictive, and Prescriptive Analytics Techniques
Descriptive Analytics
Descriptive analytics entails the technique focused on analyzing past data, providing insights that can assist organizations in making decisions. The analysis of previously obtained data can be applied to determine what has happened, which can then determine the likelihood of future events (Fahl, 2017). Descriptive analytics can help with various population management tasks such as health data analytics (El Morr & Ali Hassan, 2019). However, the use spans beyond the healthcare realm; most of the statistics used in daily business operations fall into the descriptive analysis category (Fahl, 2017). This analysis has been largely adopted and utilized in many businesses around the United Arab Emirates to solve managerial issues.
Innovative solutions often come as an organizational response to novel challenges. In social sciences, descriptive analytics is used to analyze contemporary tasks when boundaries between the actual phenomenon and real life are not evident (Mahmood et al., 2019). This approach is used in UAE increasingly: for instance, UAE has experienced a rapid rise in technological diversity in the XXI century. Organizations face the inevitable complexity in distinguishing the present and anticipated changes, requiring a scientific approach to problem-solving. Within the framework of decision science, a descriptive insight allowed to attain the prospective solution.
The transition in technology has resulted in managerial problems within UAE. Therefore, practical decision-making was required to solve the underlying problem. Specifically, organizations had to produce methods of utilizing the changing technology to institute performance among employees. The use of descriptive analysis allowed UAE businesses to observe trends such as, for instance, average salaries in given years or individuals’ spending power (Fahl, 2017). Analyzing such data allowed to form a comprehensive evaluation and to meet the increasing performance demands of the organization.
Predictive Analytics
Predictive analytics is the summative assessment technique that mainly relies on predictive modeling. It is a method of obtaining information from already collected data and predicting behavioral patterns and trends (Fahl, 2017). Predictive modeling helps to minimize uncertainty not just in the future but also in the present and past (Fahl, 2017). Data-driven predictive analytics models detect patterns or relationships in historical data and then project the discovered relationships into the future (Greasley, 2019). Such an approach is convenient since it predicts an outcome that can enhance organizational ability to adjust their decision accordingly.
Predictive analytics in the business world mainly deals with experimental queries: for example, predicting an organization’s annual revenue or a product demand at a future time. This approach can be used for problems that involve decision science, for instance, in online marketing. Recently, UAE was faced with several marketing challenges, which called for a change in its strategy (Alomar et al., 2020). Dubai, which has been experiencing an increase in tourism, struggled to showcase its products globally (Alomar et al., 2020). The predictive analysis technique has a profound impact on the ways organizations market their products to reach global coverage.
Predictive analysis, however, is capable of solving much more complex challenges than single-sentence queries. Decision-makers can effectively apply predictive analytics by performing the process of data mining and hypothesis testing (Dinesh Kumar, 2017). With the help of relevant variables, a statistical model can then be developed. Such models have been adopted to solve performance-related challenges (Sun et al., 2021). Predictive modeling plays a major role in performance evaluation, allowing for efficient metrics consideration and enhancing the accuracy of outcomes.
Prescriptive Analytics
Prescriptive analytics is the frontier of business analytics, which identifies the optimal solution for a problem or generally the best course of action. It mainly relies on artificial intelligence to assist the decision-maker with identifying the optimal solution, given the problem context (Dinesh Kumar, 2017). This framework can produce several optimized alternatives depending on the problem complexity and within a reasonable period (Mahammed et al., 2018). Often, computer-generated solutions are highly efficient for solving complex organizational challenges.
Organizations use prescriptive analytics to solve complex optimization problems of the modern era. A recent analysis by Mahmood et al. (2019) revealed that the UAE adopted this technique to analyze the rational use of medicine and prescription drugs within several local hospitals. For instance, the study adopted a multicenter prospective cross-sectional comparative design to analyze four critical locations (Mahmood et al., 2019). The prescriptive analysis highly influenced the decision and affirmed the importance of such strategies in minimizing the consequences of poly-pharmacy.

Data Management Risks’ Evaluation
A well-regulated and secure data management system is crucial for successfully maintaining a business. Breach of security is commonly attributed to human or machine aspects, and organizational flaws. Misplacement of data negatively impacts organizations’ operations since time and resources are diverted towards retrieving the lost information. Irreparable file loss often damages the operations and thus employees’ performance. Data loss occurs in several forms: it can happen through electronic erasure or physical damage to data storage. Whichever instance it is, all of them may render data unusable for the intended purposes.
While, in some cases, data loss is recoverable, there is no guarantee for recovering the entirety of data every time. Accidental file deletion has been a major data threat to some aspects of operations, especially when backing up files is not commonly practiced (Hubbard, 2020). Recoverable deletion mainly relies on artificial intelligence and backup sources; it also relies on costly and skills of the IT department experts. Both suffering the data loss and recovering the data may be substantially expensive.
The occurrence of data loss has resulted in catastrophic impacts, most notable including disruption of the organizational activities in terms of day-to-day operations. Several risks have been associated with data loss, which has proved costly for the organization to manage. For instance, there may be a 5% annual chance of a major data breach. If the breach occurs, there is a 90% chance the financial impact will be between $1 million and $20 million (Hubbard, 2020). Besides the cost factor, organization productivity suffers in data loss, particularly on the loss of production-related data.
Causes
Manpower Causes: Human Errors
Human resources cause is directly associated with people’s actions, whether it be employees, higher management, or any other human beings. Human errors are classified under two categories: intentional and unintentional errors. Intentional errors are purported actions: purposeful deletion of data from a computer system or leaking vital information to outsiders. Unintentional include accidental deletion of data or accidental sharing of files. Arguably, human error is managed by administering proper training to enhance human skills (Hubbard, 2020). Additionally, human access to machines can be controlled to manage intentional actions of individuals on data loss.
Manpower Causes: Computer Theft
Computer theft is the second human-related action that results in data loss. It entails an actual loss of machines containing crucial data of the organization. Recently, analysis indicated the transition from immobile computers to personal laptops; the resulting increase in portability raises the instances of theft (Paluzzi, 2019). Often, an employee’s loss of their laptop results in the subsequent loss of data or breach in security (Ponemon Institute LLC, 2018). Overall, loss of property such as personal computers or hard drives frequently results in the subsequent breach of data safety.
Machine Causes: Malware and Viruses
Viruses are unintended computer programs that alter the functionality of computer applications. The occurrence of viruses commonly results in increased loss of data due to the destruction of the operating system. Viruses enter systems through connections such as file downloads and email links. Such links contain malware that alters the operation and damages computer software. Backing up data while keeping installed antivirus will prevent data loss within the organization (Hubbard, 2020). However, the optimal and most applied solution for the problem is installing antivirus software that then acts as a guard against malware.
Material and Hardware Damage
Hardware is a vital component of the computer; it stores a voluminous amount of data that is crucial for its operation. Damage to hardware may result in a total loss of data. For instance, hard drives often occur as secondary storage; their fragile construction renders them susceptible to damage. 140,000 drives crash daily, resulting in a total loss of data stored on them, which indicates the vulnerability of this method ( Mohammed, Ambak, Mosa, & Syamsunur, 2019). To prevent data loss that results from hard drive damage, additional secondary storage should be attached to the system while keeping backup constantly and periodically. Companies may administer personnel training to minimize damage related to handling.
Environmental Causes: Power Outage
Power is critical in every organization; an outage resulting in a sudden shutdown of servers and personal computers could result in total data loss. Businesses may install backup generators in workplaces to quickly mitigate the impact of power outages. Natural disasters may also have a sudden and drastic effect on data security through physical impact. For instance, floods, earthquakes, and tsunamis may directly result in the machine destruction and total loss of data. Businesses may create a solution to this through modern technologies such as cloud backups.
Investment Analysis
Maximax Optimistic
Under the maximax approach, the decision-maker chooses the action to result in the best payoff in the market. Following the Maximax criterion, the manager in this situation would aim for the decision alternative with the highest potential profit. In the best-case scenario, commodity investment may provide a payoff of $32,760. Based on the optimistic approach, the most desirable decision is to invest in commodities. This decision may provide the decision-maker with comparatively higher rates than either mutual funds or cryptocurrency.
Minimax Regret
The minimax regret approach is adapted to institute an investment decision with the least regrets or, in other words, with losses minimized. Based on the analysis, mutual funds have the minimax regret with the value of $6,110. Based on the minimax regret approach, the most desirable decision is to invest in mutual funds. This decision may secure the decision-maker with comparatively lesser losses than commodities or cryptocurrency.
Decision Tree"
"The framers of the Constitution did not believe that citizens would take an active part in the political life of the country. While many freedoms were incorporated in the Constitution, its framers doubted whether people were interested enough in politics to follow its makings. It is true that in those times, information was limited; however, nowadays, mass media help people to be well-informed about political events. Moreover, the media act as a watchdog on the governmental powers (How Does the Media Affect Politics). Informational agencies report the events and let readers make their minds about them or share their views (How Does the Media Affect Politics). However, it always pays not to rely on the media too much and take pains to follow the political life of the country. They felt that everyday citizens were uninformed and did not care what was going on in our government.
I disagree that citizens are uninformed and do not care about political life. Nowadays, there are many organizations that promote civil rights and freedoms closely following the events on the political landscape of the country. People do not wait for a crisis to voice their opinions; on the contrary, citizens try to stay well-informed about what is going on (Jach & Trolian, 2022). The media, as a great source of information, facilitates this task, allowing people to have access to the latest events all over the world (Greenberg & Page, 2015). Crises as such make people more interested in politics, but there are many people who take pains to voice their opinions, notwithstanding the political or economic situation. These people deserve great respect as they act as watchdogs on the wide judicial, legislative, and executive powers vested in our politicians and judges by the laws we have adopted as a nation."
"The researchers base their conclusion on three well-designed case studies touching on various software applications. The case studies include evaluating bone fractures following traffic accidents, bone injuries caused by a spade, and gunshot wounds on the head, which offer valuable data on enhancing contemporary forensic investigations (Buck et al., 2008). The modeling software and haptic device used for the study boast high precision, low friction, superior fidelity, and output capacity of six degrees of freedom. In the present world, these are top-notch specifications for such discourses. However, replicating the study to verify the findings may prove a challenge due to the high cost of assembling all the specimens and equipment utilized therein (Pinzon et al., 2016).
The researchers do well to draw their interpretations and conclusions from the gathered data involving the three separate case studies cited above. The results of the studies indicate that haptic devices can prove very valuable in post-mortem and forensic investigations. In forensic science, the research can be instrumental in enabling investigators to recreate a crime scene (such as gun-holding position) and identify the object used in the crime with enhanced precision and speed. Hagmann et al. (2021) thus note that the use of haptics in forensic science can hasten the criminal justice process and make investigations more reliable.
The research is highly innovative as it facilitates the use of technology to recreate crime scenes and enables the user to get the sense of touch often lost during such virtual excursions. Thus, the user can handle and feel 3D digital information, which is significant innovation and improves current technologies. According to Joukal et al. (2015), there may arise controversies surrounding the use of haptics due to fears of corrupting operating systems and online hacking to manipulate investigation findings. Such possibilities may impact the reliability of such devices in criminal justice proceedings. In terms of ethics, the machines make investigations much more expensive to conduct due to costly equipment and training for personnel involved (Fahrni et al., 2019). The costs may hinder the quest for justice in some cases, primarily in low-income areas. Nevertheless, the innovation is evident, and the researchers do well to draw solid conclusions based on their three well-designed case studies."
"Introduction:
The aging process affects every aspect of our biology, and the brain is no exception. As our population ages, the prevalence of age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, continues to rise, imposing a significant burden on individuals, families, and healthcare systems. However, recent advancements in neuroscience have shed light on the potential therapeutic use of neural stem cells (NSCs) in counteracting age-related brain deterioration. This essay will explore the research articles that support the proposition that NSCs can effectively slow or halt the aging process in the brain.
Body:
I. Understanding the Aging Brain:
To assess the potential therapeutic effects of NSCs, it is essential to comprehensively understand the underlying mechanisms of brain aging. Age-related degeneration primarily involves chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and a decline in the regenerative capacity of the brain. As a result, the brain experiences a loss of neuronal connections, impaired cognitive function, and an increased susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases.
II. Neural Stem Cells:
A. Characteristics and Sources:
NSCs are self-renewing progenitor cells capable of differentiating into various neural cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. They exist in specific regions of the adult brain, such as the hippocampus and subventricular zone, indicating their role in continuous neurogenesis and maintenance of brain plasticity. Additionally, NSCs can be extracted from other sources, such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) or embryonic stem cells (ESCs).
B. Benefits of Neural Stem Cells:
1. Neurogenesis: NSCs possess the unique ability to generate new neurons, thereby replenishing the neuronal population lost during aging and neurodegeneration. Numerous animal studies have demonstrated that increased neurogenesis through NSC transplantation improves cognitive function and enhances learning and memory capabilities.
2. Trophic Support: NSCs secrete various growth factors and cytokines that possess neuroprotective properties. These factors can mitigate inflammation, reduce oxidative stress, and enhance synaptic plasticity, promoting brain health and resilience against age-related damage.
III. Evidence Supporting Therapeutic Application of Neural Stem Cells:
A. Animal Studies:
1. Aging Reversal: Experimentation with animal models has shown that NSCs transplantation can reverse age-related cognitive impairments. In one study, aged rats receiving NSC transplants demonstrated improved memory performance and synaptic plasticity, indicating a potential halt or reversal of brain aging.
2. Disease Modification: NSCs have been effectively employed in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Transplantation of NSCs not only reduced disease-related pathology but also improved sensory-motor functions, suggesting their broader therapeutic potential.
B. Human Studies:
1. Safety and Feasibility: Early-phase clinical trials investigating the transplantation of NSCs have reported its safety and feasibility in humans. No serious adverse events were observed, suggesting that NSCs hold promise for future therapeutic application.
2. Limited Efficacy Findings: Although initial human studies have not shown definitive efficacy in treating age-related brain disorders, they highlight our growing understanding of NSC behavior and pave the way for improved protocols and methodologies.
IV. Potential Challenges and Future Perspectives:
While the research articles present encouraging evidence regarding the therapeutic use of NSCs, several challenges must be addressed before widespread adoption can occur. These include the optimization of cell sources, ethical considerations, standardization of transplantation techniques, and long-term safety concerns.
Conclusion:
The evidence from the provided research articles strongly supports the therapeutic potential of NSCs in slowing or halting the aging process in the brain. By harnessing their capacity for neurogenesis and neuroprotection, NSCs hold great promise as a novel therapeutic strategy for age-related brain disorders. Continued research, validation, and advancements in techniques will lead us closer to a future where the aging brain can be protected and rejuvenated, allowing individuals to retain their cognitive functions and overall quality of life."
"Introduction:
William Shakespeare's Othello takes a deep dive into the intricate theme of honor and its impact on the main characters, Othello and Iago. As the plot unravels, it becomes evident that honor is not perceived uniformly by these characters, leading them down contrasting paths of action and ultimately resulting in devastating consequences. This essay examines the perception of honor in Othello and Iago, exploring how it drives their actions and the subsequent fallout on their relationships with others.
Perception of Honor in Othello:
Othello, a celebrated general, attaches immense significance to honor, considering it an indivisible part of his identity as both a soldier and a man. To Othello, honor embodies traits such as nobility, integrity, and valor. When a seed of doubt is planted by Iago regarding the faithfulness of his wife, Desdemona, Othello's perception of honor quickly becomes entangled with his personal pride. He becomes consumed by the desire to preserve his reputation and uphold his sense of honor, leading him down a path of destruction. In the pursuit of honor, Othello is gradually transformed from a noble figure into a tragic victim of manipulation.
Perception of Honor in Iago:
Contrastingly, Iago's perception of honor deviates from conventional virtue, as he perceives it more as an opportunity for personal gain and revenge. Lacking the military accolades and recognition granted to Othello, Iago's envy festers into a quest to extinguish Othello's honor and create chaos in his relationships. To Iago, honor is merely a facade and, in a Machiavellian sense, a tool to be exploited for manipulation. His actions are not driven by a genuine desire for honor but rather by an insidious need to elevate himself at the expense of others.
Consequences of their Actions:
Driven by their differing perceptions of honor, Othello and Iago's actions have devastating consequences. Othello's blind trust in Iago's manipulations leads him to question and ultimately murder his innocent wife, Desdemona. This act strips him of his own honor, reducing him to a mere vessel of Iago's deceit. Othello's misplaced perception of honor not only costs him the love of his life but also shatters the trust and respect others had for him, thereby alienating him from those around him.
Similarly, Iago's manipulations sow seeds of doubt and suspicion among the other characters, unraveling the fabric of their relationships. For instance, Roderigo's blind loyalty to Iago stems from his belief that Iago is an honorable companion seeking to restore his love, Desdemona. However, Roderigo's fate is sealed when Iago ultimately manipulates him into an ill-fated altercation. This chain reaction of deceit takes its toll on Iago's relationships, leaving him isolated and despised by those who once trusted him.
Impact on Relationships:
Othello and Iago's flawed perception of honor fractures both their personal relationships and those around them. Othello's decision to blindly trust Iago instead of confiding in his wife ultimately poisons their marriage and, ultimately, results in both of their deaths. Moreover, his actions inadvertently estrange him from his closest allies, such as Cassio, whose honor is unjustly tarnished under Iago's manipulation.
Iago, on the other hand, revels in the crumbling relationships he has sown, deriving pleasure from the widespread destruction caused by his malicious intent. As Iago's deceit is revealed, his web of lies destroys the bonds he once shared with those in his reach. Othello, Desdemona, Roderigo, and even his own wife, Emilia, become casualties in his quest for personal honor.
Conclusion:
Shakespeare's Othello magnifies the themes of honor and the far-reaching consequences of its misperception through the characters of Othello and Iago. While Othello views honor as an integral part of his identity and falls victim to his misplaced trust, Iago perverts honor to serve his nefarious purposes. The tragedy unfolds as both characters' actions driven by their distorted perceptions of honor result in the destruction of their relationships with others. Othello's descent into jealousy, betrayal, and madness, alongside Iago's manipulation and deceit, exemplify the harrowing consequences of unchecked perceptions of honor."
"Introduction:
As the field of robotics continues to advance, testing and simulations have become indispensable tools for developing highly functional and autonomous robots. These techniques play a critical role in ensuring the seamless functionality of robots while mitigating potential risks. Additionally, the design and evaluation of obstacle courses within real-world simulations provide invaluable insights into a robot's performance, aiding the refinement of its abilities. This essay will explore the significance of testing and simulations in robotics, discussing their contribution to robot functionality, autonomy, and the process of designing and evaluating obstacle courses.
I. The Importance of Testing in Robotics (300 words)
A. Ensuring Functionality:

The continuous improvement enabled by these methods further enriches the functionality, autonomy, and reliability of robots, setting the stage for future advancements in the field."
"The concept of “gender roles” is often applied to the analysis and comprehension of writings from various historical periods. These responsibilities appear to have been firmly defined during the Anglo-Saxon period. The poem Beowulf belongs to the epic or heroic poetry genre, which has poems that commemorate the characters’ brave and martial actions. Women are portrayed as belongings for the advantage of the men throughout Beowulf and are made to support the male characters. In addition, women are utilized as plot devices to advance the story tale of men. Women, on the other hand, are a minor character in the plot, their presence being overshadowed by the men.
The queen of the Swedes was given no name, her identity being secondary to her status as the king’s wife, Onela. The males, such as Hrothgar, Beowulf, Wiglaf, and Unferth, occupied the majority of the storyline of the poem. As a result, mentions of women are few and far between in comparison. “…the Helming woman went on her rounds…treating the family and the collected troop,” the poem says of a woman who fulfills traditional gender responsibilities as a character Beowulf (Heaney 620). The passage represents the expectation of women in the eleventh century, that they should look after males and be gentle. Queen Modthryth was presented later in the tale as the antithesis to Queen Hygd, who was autonomous and despised by men. “Even a queen of great beauty must not overstep like that,” they said dismissively. (Beowulf 1940-1941), until she married Offa, who rewarded her for her self-control. Queen Modthryth was only considered acceptable by society once she married, implying that women had less value unless they were married."
"Customer loyalty is a positive perception of the company and its products. The loyalty ladder is the structural model that implies the different levels of customer engagement in the selling process of a company’s products (Gerami & Vahid Yazdanian, 2018). Usually, the researchers define five levels of customer loyalty: suspects, prospects, customers, clients, and advocates (Gerami & Vahid Yazdanian, 2018). The loyalty ladder is an efficient tool to establish long-term relationships with clients. Different companies apply various marketing strategies to move customers from one level of the ladder to another.
A loyal customer predominantly buys goods and services from only one brand, not paying attention to its competitors’ offers. Such a customer is the main driving force of the business, in the long run, helping to build a positive image of the company and advertising it for free in his inner circle. Therefore, creating a loyal customer base and assessing customer loyalty is a top priority for a company that plans to remain in demand on the market for a long time.
In today’s e-business, the loyalty ladder is exceptionally vital in attracting customers online. The e-marketing strategies allow more advanced methods to build efficient loyalty programs. For the analysis of the practical appliance of the loyalty ladder, two brands of organic cosmetics were chosen: Pacifica and Annmarie. Both retailers provide online opportunities and loyalty programs for customers. Considering their activities from the perspective of customer loyalty, the brands’ programs aim at different ladder levels. The first online brand, Pacifica, offers a digital gift card ( Digital gift card , n.d.). A gift card of over 50 dollars in total is beneficial for the customers due to the random gift of over 75 dollars ( Digital gift card , n.d.). Thus, the card attracts new customers and benefits the current clients. Moreover, the cards have a thematic design relevant to many celebrations.
The marketing strategy used by the brand aims at the recurrent buying of the customers. The program addresses the prospect’s and clients’ levels from the loyalty ladder perspective. However, it fails to establish the advocates’ relationships with the clients. Considering the variability of the brand, which can be found online, the strategy is poor in terms of long-time loyalty. The customer is not directly involved in the brand. Thereby, the chances of choosing other brands are higher. Though considering the mentioned ladder levels, the program is successful.
The second example relevant to the analysis is Annmarie cosmetics. The company created the Wild & Beautiful Collective loyalty program to move the customer from the client’s level to the advocates ( Join the Wild & Beautiful Collective , n. d.). The community created for regular customers allows the company to develop its brand by providing discounts and point programs. The constant contact with other clients and creators of the brand empowers the higher level of engagement. As a result, clients are more focused on one brand, which minimizes the risk of competitors’ victory. This approach is highly relevant for e-commerce, enhancing loyalty. The program is beneficial for both the brand and customers due to paid subscriptions and various privileges. However, Annmarie’s strategy fails at the level of attracting new customers. Even though the profound base of loyal customers and advocates is established, broadening the brand’s potential is also vital for future development.
Therefore, both brands provide loyalty programs based on their current needs. They succeed on one level while failing at another. Addressing all the levels of the ladder would be the perfect strategy for both retailers. However, brands promote programs relevant to the current budget and opportunities. Annmarie’s approach is more efficient from a long-term perspective. The Pacifica’s one is beneficial in terms of broadening the client base."
"It is important to note that brain tissue is among the most complex and intricate structures of the human body, which has a highly limited capacity for healing and regeneration. The topic of the proposed research is to assess how neural stem cells replace and differentiate into neurons and other cells of the brain in order to use them for therapeutic purposes. N eural stems cells must be used as a therapeutic measure to slow or halt the aging process due to their rejuvenation and differentiation capabilities.

Literature Review
Part 1
The preliminary research suggests that there is a complex system of regulatory steps that involve GABA signaling. There is an array of signaling molecules involved in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) neurogenesis, such as Sonic hedgehog, fibroblast growth factor 2, glutamate, and others. The subgranular zone (SGZ) is another important germinal region of the adult human brain, and the mechanisms of regulations are comparatively different between V-SVZ and SGZ.
Part 2
For example, a key source of the proposal states that “V-SVZ NSCs are regulated by local signals from their immediate neighbors, as well as by neurotransmitters and factors that are secreted by distant neurons, the choroid plexus, and vasculature” (Obernier & Alvarez-Buylla, 2019, p. 1). In other words, distantly located cells secrete a wide range of signaling molecules to regulate the neural stem cell generation, differentiation, and regeneration processes.

"Introduction:
Moral universalism and moral relativism have long been at odds, representing opposite ends of the ethical spectrum. While moral relativism emphasizes cultural and individual differences in defining morality, moral universalism posits that there exist objective moral truths applicable to all humans. This essay argues that despite the initial divergence, arguments made in favor of moral relativism ultimately lead back to moral universalism through the recognition of a common core moral code and the need to regulate human relations.
Body:
1. Cultural and Situational Differences:
   Moral relativism suggests that moral truths are relative to culture and context, acknowledging the diversity of ethical beliefs worldwide. However, upon closer examination, we find that even within varying cultures, certain fundamental moral values prevail. For instance, the sanctity of life, fairness, and honesty are upheld across societies, suggesting the existence of a common core moral code. Thus, moral relativism inadvertently highlights the shared principles that underpin diverse ethical frameworks.
2. Individual Autonomy and Subjectivity:
   An argument often made in favor of moral relativism is that individuals have the right to define their own moral values, championing individual autonomy. While this emphasis on subjectivity is important, it becomes apparent that it cannot entirely escape universal moral principles. The recognition and respect for individual autonomy itself stems from a core moral value, that of valuing personal freedom. Therefore, even in embracing moral relativism, one is implicitly acknowledging the universality of certain moral ideals.
3. Moral Progress and Social Regulation:
   Proponents of moral relativism argue that it allows for moral progress, accommodating societal changes and evolving values. However, in situations where cultural practices or individual beliefs lead to harm or injustice, moral relativism encounters a dilemma. As societies strive to regulate human relations, preventing harm and safeguarding individual rights, a form of moral universalism inevitably arises. For instance, the global consensus against practices such as slavery and child labor attests to the existence of universal moral values that transcend cultural relativism.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, the arguments in favor of moral relativism frequently lead back to moral universalism. Through the recognition of a common core moral code shared by diverse cultures and the importance of regulating human relations to prevent harm, moral relativism ultimately converges with universal ethical principles. While acknowledging the legitimacy of individual autonomy and relative cultural diversity, an inherent convergence highlights the existence of objective moral truths applicable to all humans. The ongoing dialogue between moral relativism and moral universalism reflects the complex nature of morality and the need to find a harmonious balance between individual autonomy and shared ethical values."
"Introduction
The advancement of data and communication technology provides a new possibility for developing company strategies centered on client value co-creation. This is especially noticeable in the financial sector, more specifically, the banking field. In this situation, the competitive process can be aided by e-banking operations. Financial services are currently evolving in tandem with technological advancements. Clients always had to come directly to the financial institution to perform activities with their money. However, with the progress of technologies, the same actions were allowed to be done distantly with the help of electronic banking (e-banking).
Today, e-banking implies a financial information system provided by the bank using modern wireless technology to facilitate the quick and easy conduct of financial transactions. The objective of this paper is to investigate the field of electronic banking and explore the correlation between e-banking and customer satisfaction. The significance of our study is in the critical issues of e-banking and the areas of improvement that the banks can eliminate or improve to boost customer satisfaction. To increase customer satisfaction with e-banks, businesses must increase the following factors: speed of operations, dependability, safety and confidentiality, and a client-oriented approach.
Literature Review
In the last 10-20 years, financial institutions have significantly moved from traditional financing to E-banking (Khatoon, Zhengliang, and Hussain, 2020). The waves of development and technical breakthroughs aided banks in expanding their number of clients and E-banking products, which paved the way for financial services to flourish and become more accessible (Khatoon, Zhengliang, and Hussain, 2020). Clients now can see watch their account balances, perform cash transactions, deposit accounts, text, and transfer payments to other individuals and companies using directions supplied to their smartphones by institutions.
Electronic banking is also known as internet or mobile banking. These are platforms that banks may use to offer clients easier access to services (Nurhadi and Ilfitriah, 2020). Namely, a client utilizing online banking does so via a computer connected to the internet, while a consumer using banking apps does so using a smartphone or tablet (Khatoon, Zhengliang, and Hussain, 2020). According to Khatoon, Zhengliang, and Hussain (2020), wireless usage of e-banking demonstrates the distinction between the two types of banking settings, while users consider flexibility to be among the most crucial characteristic of the electronic banking business. The most important aspect of electronic banking is its dependability (Haq and Awan, 2020). More significantly, bank consumers think that important online financial institutions are being utilized, even though digital banking is the least expensive route.
Customer Satisfaction
Client satisfaction is among the essential topics in consumer research nowadays. In general, it connects buying process to post-buying phenomena, including attitude adjustment, purchase frequency, and brand recognition (Al Ali, 2021). According to Hammoud, Bizri, and El Baba (2018), a sense of pleasure occurs when consumers share their impression of the goods or services and when their experiences align with the expectations. Thus, satisfaction levels correlate directly with the work of banks’ apps and services.
Define consumer satisfaction, a variety of definitions have been presented. Nonetheless, the concept of evaluating service execution and assumptions appears to be shared by most interpretations. Hammoud, Bizri, and El Baba (2018) describe satisfaction as a favorable post-purchase assessment judgment about a good or service. Likewise, Banu, Mohamed, and Parayitam (2019) described client satisfaction as a customer reaction to the appraisal of the observed gap between hopes and outcomes after usage. Satisfaction may also be defined as the result of a post-purchase evaluation of a service or good as opposed to the prior-buying stage’s expectations.
Other studies, contrary to this, have discovered that the influence exercised throughout the purchase and consuming stages of the goods or services may also have a significant effect on the user’s judgments of contentment. Therefore, client satisfaction is a consumer’s experience of joy or unhappiness after comparing an item’s or service’s effectiveness to their expectations (Carranza et al., 2021). Following these criteria and the context of this study, client satisfaction is the overall user’s perspective formed in reaction to utilizing any type of E-Banking service. As a result, E-Banking qualities may enhance, decline, or maintain the same level of client contentment.
Customer Satisfaction and E-Banking
With a variety of research pointing to a link between e-banking customer experience and customer happiness, the issue lies within the definition of services of products that make customers increasingly happy and satisfied. According to our study’s examination of the literature, the following factors play an immense role in client satisfaction: speed of operations, dependability, safety and confidentiality, and a client-oriented approach (Usman, Monoarfa, and Marsofiyati, 2020). With the proper combination of these elements, an e-banking organization will be able to increase the level of customer satisfaction. Additionally, to create a bigger client base, Alabsy (2018) advises banks to make a more extensive awareness of the service ambiguity.
The speed of operations implies the speed of money transfers, payments, money withdrawals, or money deposits. Dependability in this situation can be described as the overall reliability of the app and the safety of its usage. Additionally, safety and confidentiality prove to play a significant role in the evaluation of satisfaction levels. In case an organization has a bad reputation and a scandalous record, the level of trust in the company can significantly decline. The last factor, the client-oriented approach, is responsible for the quick response of the support team. Proper responses from support teams can change the attitudes of clients drastically.
Methodology
The given research is based on the qualitative approach, which focuses on the accumulation and analysis of the retrieved information. Among the chosen variables were the e-banks such as PayPal Bank, WebMoney Bank, and Payoneer Bank. The selected sample was a group of five people who willingly decided to participate in the study and share their opinions on their experiences while testing the banks mentioned above, specifically their services. The selected group analyzed in one day and shared their results via a Google platform.
As has been mentioned, the analyzed literature has defined the following elements like the ones that contribute to client satisfaction from e-banks: speed of operations, dependability, safety and confidentiality, and a client-oriented approach. Therefore, the group of volunteers has been asked to test the apps of the banks and rate the given variables from 1 to 5, which in further stages of the research helped understand the correlation between the mentioned factors and the level of satisfaction. To collect the data correctly, a platform such as Google Forms was utilized.
According to the findings, the e-bank WebMoney Bank provided the lowest results and, therefore, did not lead to customer satisfaction. On the other hand, all five participants gave PayPal Bank the highest rates for speed of operations, dependability, safety and confidentiality, and a client-oriented approach. Therefore, the findings indicated that these factors influenced client satisfaction drastically. Nevertheless, the conducted research contains limitations, which could lead to low-quality results. Among the limitations is the sample size which might be considered insufficient for robust statistical data. Moreover, the chosen individuals could be biased towards the mentioned e-banks, which could lead to the distortion of the evidence. Lastly, time constraints also played a key role in determining the success of the research.
Conclusion
Hence, nowadays, a significant number of businesses allow their consumers to access almost all of their services and products via multiple channels, notably electronic banking. From this perspective, the usage of e-banking by financial institution consumers is seen as a significant achievement and has been thoroughly investigated in many kinds of research. Decades ago clients had to go directly to the financial institution and today everything can be accessed via smartphones and other gadgets. Yet, while more and more services are being offered to consumers, the key is client satisfaction, which can be defined by several factors.
According to the analyzed studies, among the factors that play the most prominent role in client satisfaction speed of operations, dependability, safety and confidentiality, and a client-oriented approach are the leading elements. To compare the given information with reality, research was conducted with the help of five participants. The testes banks, PayPal Bank, WebMoney Bank, and Payoneer Bank, revealed that the leading e-platform is PayPal Bank, whose factors were proven to be high-quality and led to client satisfaction."
"In the survey The Effect Of Work Relationships On Organizational Culture And Commitment, as many as 89% of respondents confirmed that communication with colleagues affects the quality of life (Suhardi, 2020). It also turned out that if a person has at least one friend at work, it connects him more strongly with the company and supports his desire to stay in this place. Feeling connected to other people supports employees’ interest and involvement in work. Talking to colleagues, a person gradually gets rid of the fear of expressing their ideas and comments.
Scientists from the University of Michigan conducted an interesting experiment, Friends (and Sometimes Enemies) With Cognitive Benefits: What Types of Social Interactions Boost Executive Functioning? The participants were divided into two groups: first, the first group subjects had to get to know each other for 10 minutes. And the second group was asked to participate in disputes among themselves on a certain topic. Then all the subjects were asked to solve several cognitive tasks. The experiment participants from the first group, who had previously just communicated in a relaxed atmosphere, showed the best results in solving problems. They had significant improvements in the executive functions of the brain. These processes are responsible for planning, concentration, prioritization, and organization. In other words, for the skills and qualities that we need to work."
"Introduction
Management accounting involves measuring and reporting of economic activities of an enterprise. It is vital for the decision-making and planning of any organization and society. Managers primarily depend on the information provided by this paradigm for forecasting, operational control, and performance evaluation. For instance, managers use this information to decide what to produce, make, and when to produce. Therefore, it is helpful to them in determining various costs involved in the production process and the needed resources to attain the company’s objectives.
Additionally, the management accounting system is financial in nature. Therefore, it feeds into the financial accounting system, especially in the product costing system, which is vital in calculating the cost of sales used in the income statement and inventory cost used in the balance sheets. Arguably, this information can be seen as the backbone to the excellent management and operation of large organizations. Thus its preparation should be made monthly or quarterly and given to the various managers, including the chief financial officers, for efficient operation of their duties. This paper, hence, seeks to create a comprehensive report and analysis of the actual financial performance vis-a-vis the budgeted performance to be presented to the chief financial officer.
Summary
The actual net profit of 1036.8 shows that the company is in good operation and can secure financing and investments. However, the budgeted net profit is 153.9 higher due to the lower sales volume in the actual performance. This then signals the sales and marketing department to adjust their marketing strategy to prevent the sales lag that is deterring the company from reaching its plans. Conversely, comparing the actual and budgeted net profit margins, the 15.88 % profit margin indicates that the company earns 15.88 cents for every dollar it collects instead of £15.71 that was budgeted (Maheshwari, Maheshwari, and Maheshwari, 2021). This shows that the company is operating optimally and is highly capable of meeting its objectives. This analysis, therefore, deems it fit for the company to try and reduce the cost of sales for it to generate higher profit margins. Consequently, the company is required to minimize the selling costs and increase its sales volume to continue earning higher returns. Similarly, in the analysis of this data, the liquidity ratio is also vital to examine as it determines whether the company can pay off current debt obligations.
The liquidity ratio shows the company is relatively in a good position to clear its current debts without using the inventory financing method, which is the least liquid. Its quick ratio of 0.8 indicates that it has £0.81 of liquid assets without inventory to cover £1 liability (Maheshwari, Maheshwari, and Maheshwari, 2021). Although the company desires to achieve 1.02, it is not close to insolvency. With all these analyses, it is prudent to argue that the company is in good operation for the foreseeable future.

Pie Chart Showing Both Performance of the Company
Budgeted costs performance for the whole year.
Actual costs performance for the whole year.
In the data above, direct labor costs take a more considerable percentage of all the costs involved in the performance of this company. Direct labor costs apply to the cost of labor that can be traced to the creation of a product without unnecessary expenses, for example, the salaries and wages paid to the workers. It takes a more considerable percentage because it determines the volume of production (Maheshwari, Maheshwari, and Maheshwari, 2021). As production increases, labor cost also increases; that is why in the budgeted performance, the cost of direct labor is 2% higher than the actual cost of direct labor. It is followed by direct material cost, which includes the cost of raw materials and the items used to create the products. The direct materials in the bakery industry, for example, would consist of flour, eggs, oil, and water. It also contributes a bigger percentage of costs in the production process.
When the production is increased, the output will be increased, and thus the inputs costs, including direct materials, must increase. This is evident in the two charts as it indicates that the direct materials costs are higher in the budgeted performance with higher sales. It is followed by the variable cost in the chart, variable costs are the business expenses that changes according to the output or sales. Therefore it varies linearly with the output level. On most occasions, it decreases with the increase in production or sales, as depicted from the charts (Maheshwari, Maheshwari, and Maheshwari, 2021). The budgeted plan with higher sales has a lower percentage of the variable cost than the actual plan with lower sales. It is closely followed by the fixed cost, which includes those costs that do not change when production or sales volume changes; they do not vary with the output volume. Always the total fixed cost does not change, and they remain within a given range.
However, the cost per unit of fixed cost decreases with the increase in production because the exact fixed costs are spread over more units. This is evident in the charts above, as they shows that in the budgeted program, the fixed cost is 6.76%, and the actual program is 7.87%. Following is the distribution cost, which is associated with storing and delivering the products to the respective customers. These costs are incurred in getting the finished products to customers, for example, the cost of fuel and depreciation of the vehicle. They are directly related to the output level, as the output level increases, the distribution cost increases, as seen in the charts. The selling costs also form part of the business performance. It deals with the costs associated with getting orders or requests from customers. They include salaries and commissions paid to the sales and advertising agents. As the output increases, the need for many selling agents is necessary; therefore, it also increases but not proportionately to the output level.
Ensuing is the administration cost, which involves paying salaries and wages and giving benefits to the non-sales individuals. It is also directly related to the output volume. The Finance costs, which include the cost incurred by the management to secure funds for the organization’s activities, are also included in the costs. Finally, there is the cost of taxation which involves the charge by the government authority on the gross profit or loss of the company, including interest on debentures and dividends to shareholders. It is proportionately related to the output level as shown on the charts. As output increases, the tax also increases, thus its costs increases (Maheshwari, Maheshwari, and Maheshwari, 2021). From the above-analyzed data, we can say that both the business’s actual and planned performance is in the same line, and there is a slight diversion on the actual and intended outcome; hence, they are positively related in terms of profit goals of the company.

The graphs above measure the actual performance and the budgeted performance of the business. They show the variance between the business plan and the actual outcome. From the graphs, we can see that the budgeted; sales, operating profit, gross profit, and the actual; sales, gross profit, operating profit exhibit the same trend. The budgeted parameters designates a constant increasing growth, while all the actual parameters show a fluctuating growth. The actual parameters have a steadily increasing growth from October to February. They reach their peak in January and starts dropping in February up to March and then start to pick again with a constant speed before they start increasing increasingly in May. The performance then starts to shoot at a higher rate from august to its pick in September. As a result, this implies that the business has peak and low seasons across these performance periods, and the company should therefore strive to minimize losses during the low seasons and maximize its profits in high seasons.
Profitability Ratio Calculations for both Budgeted and Actual Years
Net profit ratio : the calculation of these ratios are derived from the statements of profit or loss accounts created above.
Actual performance
 1. 
     1. Net profit ratio = (net profit / net sales)*100 = 1036.8/6527 * 100 = 15.88
 1. 
     1. Operating profit margin = (operating profit / sales) * 100 = 1248/6527 * 100 = 19.12
Budgeted performance
 1. 
     1. Net profit ratio = (net profit / net sales)*100 = 1190.7/7577 * 100 = 15.71
 1. 
     1. Operating profit margin = (operating profit / sales) * 100 = 1419/7577 * 100 = 18.73
Liquidity Ratio Calculations for Both Budgeted and Actual Years
Quick ratio: from the statement of financial position above, the quick ratio for both the actual and budgeted performance can be obtained as follows;
Actual performance
 1. 
     1. Quick ratio = (currentassets – inventory – prepaid expeses)/ currentliabilities = (12461.3 – 4150 – 1800)/ 8324 = 0.8
 1. 
     1. Current ratio = currentassets/ currentliabilities = 12461.3/ 8324 = 1.49
Budgeted performance
 1. 
     1. Quick ratio = (currentassets – inventory – prepaid expeses)/ currentliabilities = (12615.2 – 3150 – 1000)/ 8324 = 1.02
     2. Current ratio = currentassets/ currentliabilities = 12615.2/ 8324 = 1.52
Conclusion
In conclusion, management accounting can be seen as the engine that drives every organization to success. Its financial nature also makes it possible for the managers to predict and plan for the company’s future operations. Every organization should strive to use management accounting extensively. And the managers and the users of the accounting information should practice the economic theories that form the basis of cost accounting to aid in influencing effective decision-making in large and small organizations. On the other hand, management accounting system has been seen as an evaluation tool that evaluates the profitability of individual products and product lines. Therefore, this approach should be applied in determining the relative performance and achievement of different managers under different categories, programs, and departments in the organization.
The organization would increase its accountability throughout the departments and minimize unnecessary expenses or losses. Through the management accounting, the managers would know the work in progress on the production floor and their stages of completion. This helps the line manager in spotting the bottlenecks and maintain smooth running of the production process. Therefore, it would be feasible for companies or organizations that have not incorporated this system to incorporate it and for those that have already integrated it to employ the synergistic energy in advancing it for better performance."
"In Plato's ""Gorgias,"" Plato explores the contrasting views of Socrates and Gorgias regarding rhetoric and oratory skills. While Gorgias views rhetoric as a powerful tool to persuade and manipulate others, Socrates argues that true rhetoric should prioritize moral righteousness and the pursuit of truth. These divergent perspectives on rhetoric are further elucidated when examining the characters and their use of rhetoric in the novel ""Thank You for Smoking"" by Christopher Buckley.
Gorgias, a renowned Greek orator, presents a convincing case for the power of rhetoric. He believes that oratory skills have the potential to sway opinions, regardless of the truth behind one's arguments. Gorgias's insistence on rhetoric's persuasive prowess is reflected in the character Nick Naylor, the protagonist of ""Thank You for Smoking."" As a lobbyist representing the interests of the tobacco industry, Nick adeptly utilizes rhetoric to defend his morally questionable profession. Through the clever manipulation of language and persuasive techniques, Nick manages to turn public opinion in his favor, even when faced with strong moral objections.
On the other hand, Socrates argues that rhetoric should be used as a means of seeking truth and advancing moral principles. He values the honest pursuit of knowledge and believes that true rhetoric should be grounded in objective facts rather than manipulation. This is echoed by the character Heather Holloway in ""Thank You for Smoking."" As a journalist, Heather aims to expose the deceitful practices of lobbyists like Nick Naylor. She employs rhetoric not to deceive but to reveal the truth and hold individuals accountable for their actions. Her commitment to seeking truth and justice aligns with Socrates's perspective on the ethical use of rhetoric.
While Gorgias emphasizes the power of rhetoric to manipulate, Socrates emphasizes the importance of moral righteousness and truth-seeking. ""Thank You for Smoking"" illustrates this dichotomy through the contrasting actions of Nick Naylor and Heather Holloway. Nick's persuasive rhetoric perpetuates misinformation and serves the interests of a harmful industry, while Heather's use of rhetoric aims to uncover the truth and promote ethical considerations.
In conclusion, Plato's ""Gorgias"" presents contrasting views on rhetoric and oratory skills: Gorgias highlighting their persuasive power, and Socrates emphasizing the importance of seeking truth and moral righteousness. These perspectives are reflected in ""Thank You for Smoking"" through characters like Nick Naylor and Heather Holloway. The novel serves as a poignant reminder of the ethical implications of rhetoric, prompting us to critically evaluate its use and the motives behind its employment."
"Introduction:
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted numerous aspects of our lives, including cherished traditions and social gatherings. One such tradition in our community is inter-family football competitions. These friendly matches not only promote physical activity but also foster social connections and healthy competition. However, the pandemic has forced families to reassess their plans and face unprecedented challenges in organizing these events. In this essay, we will explore the various ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic affected the plans and challenges faced by inter-family football competitions in our community.
Body:
1. Cancellation and Postponement:
The immediate impact of the pandemic was the widespread cancellation or postponement of inter-family football competitions in our community. With the enforcement of lockdown measures and limitations on social gatherings, families were unable to gather on the field as they had previously. The disappointment and frustration of not being able to engage in this beloved tradition were palpable. However, the cancellation of these events also highlighted the importance of adaptability and finding alternative ways to connect.
2. Virtual Alternatives:
In response to the cancellation of physical events, families turned to virtual alternatives to keep the spirit of inter-family football competitions alive. Online gaming platforms, such as FIFA or Pro Evolution Soccer, allowed families to simulate football matches and compete with each other remotely. While not the same as the exhilaration of a physical game, these virtual competitions provided a sense of camaraderie and a much-needed outlet for families to engage with their passion for football.
3. Technological Challenges:
Although the virtual alternatives proved to be a temporary solution, they also presented challenges of their own. Not all families had access to the necessary technology or reliable internet connections required for seamless online gaming. This digital divide led to feelings of isolation for some families who were unable to actively participate in these virtual competitions. Additionally, online gaming lacked the physicality and in-person interaction that inter-family football competitions traditionally offer, highlighting the importance of face-to-face contact and human connection.
4. Adaptation and Creativity:
Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, families in our community displayed commendable adaptability and creativity. In line with health guidelines, families began organizing small, socially distanced football matches within their immediate households. These intimate competitions allowed families to maintain some level of engagement in their beloved sport while prioritizing safety. Furthermore, some families chose to organize community-wide inter-family football competitions virtually by sharing recorded videos of their matches on social media platforms. This innovative approach not only fostered competition but also created a sense of unity within the community.
5. Mental and Physical Well-being:
Inter-family football competitions have always served as a means of promoting physical well-being and mental wellness. However, the pandemic added an additional layer of significance to these events. Engaging in physical activities, such as playing football, became essential for individuals and families as they sought ways to maintain a healthy lifestyle while adhering to lockdown restrictions. The cancellation and subsequent resurrection of these competitions highlighted the importance of physical health and the positive impact it has on mental well-being during challenging times.
Conclusion:
The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly disrupted the plans and posed significant challenges to inter-family football competitions in our community. The cancellation or postponement of these events served as a collective disappointment. However, families in our community showcased their resilience by adapting to new circumstances and finding alternative ways to engage in these competitions. The pandemic has taught us the importance of agility, creativity, and staying connected, even in times of crisis. As we emerge from this global health crisis, we must remember the invaluable role that traditions like inter-family football competitions play in bringing communities together and maintaining our well-being."
"The clothing industry is amongst the many monopolistically competitive industries. There are many clothing firms in the industry competing against each other while producing similar products. However, the firms in the industry earn competitive advantages by distinguishing their products through branding and advertisements (Davis and Özgür, 4). Product differentiation is one of the strategies commonly used by monopolistic competitive firms. Product differentiation in a clothing firm can involve designs, the quality of materials used, and the prices charged for the clothes. In advertisements, differentiation is put in physical aspects such as color, designs, elastic, and different sizes (Davis and Özgür, 7). Intangible aspects included in the clothing advertisement can be guaranteed money back, high quality, free delivery, and long-lasting usage.
Steel manufacturing is an example of an oligopolistic competitive industry. In such a market, a few steel manufacturing companies rule over other firms. The few firms are the price and trendsetters for other small companies and often form a partnership to operate successfully (Ritz 185). To distinguish themselves from their competitors, they improve their product quality, hike or lower prices, and advertise the special features of their products. In an oligopolistic market, if a leading company lowers prices, the others do not follow but rather improve their products to remain in the higher cuts of prices (Ritz 187). The few leading companies also stay competitive in the industry by setting their standards high to prevent easy entry into the industry. The firms set high standards by producing the highest quality products, selling them at a higher price, and producing them in high quantities (Ritz 189). That way, they ensure that the small or new companies fear the competition at the top thus ensuring reduced entry to the industry."
"Introduction:
Enslaved individuals throughout history have employed numerous forms of resistance to challenge and seek revenge against the institution of slavery. This essay aims to highlight how armed and organized rebellion emerged as the most powerful means of defiance against the brutality of slavery. While other forms of resistance, such as individual acts of resistance, subversive activities, and escape attempts, held their significance, the unparalleled impact and magnitude of armed rebellion demonstrate its efficacy as a tool for seeking freedom and justice.
Body:
1. Individual Acts of Resistance:
Individual acts of resistance constituted an essential form of resistance employed by enslaved individuals. These acts included sabotage, slowing down work, and feigning illness, which demonstrated personal resistance against slavery. However, individual resistance primarily served to mitigate immediate mistreatment rather than challenging the institution of slavery. While commendable, these forms of resistance lacked the potential to unravel the deeply entrenched system itself.
2. Subversive Activities and Community Mobilization:
Subversive activities, such as covert networks, secret meetings, and the spread of abolitionist literature, were vital in fostering a sense of community and gathering necessary information for rebellion. These forms of resistance were crucial in building bonds and initiating social cohesion among the enslaved population. However, lacking the physical manifestation of rebellion, they often faced limitations in achieving lasting change or inflicting comprehensive damage upon the institution of slavery.
3. Escapes and Underground Railroad:
Escape attempts and utilization of the Underground Railroad were central to undermining the system of slavery. Enslaved individuals who successfully managed to escape not only liberated themselves but also inspired hope through their stories. The Underground Railroad acted as a vital lifeline, offering escape routes and protection to fugitives. However, the effectiveness of these methods was limited, as not all enslaved individuals had access to escape opportunities, and their impact tended to be localized rather than transformative at the systemic level.
4. Armed and Organized Rebellion:
Armed rebellion, exemplified by events like the Haitian Revolution and Nat Turner's Rebellion, represented a culmination of resistance efforts. These rebellions demonstrated the enslaved population's determination to reclaim agency and challenge the institution of slavery directly. Armed rebellion allowed for collective action, strategic planning, and the dismantling of oppressive systems. Its profound shockwaves resonated across society, forcing those in power to acknowledge and contend with the injustices inherent in the system of slavery.
Conclusion:
While individual resistance, subversive activities, and escape attempts represented valiant efforts against enslavement, armed and organized rebellion remains the most potent and transformative means to challenge and seek revenge against the institution of slavery. By wielding collective power, armed rebellion struck fear in the hearts of oppressors, uprooting the very foundations of the brutal institution. The undeniable impact of armed rebellion in altering the course of history demonstrates its unparalleled effectiveness in demanding freedom and justice for enslaved individuals."
"The Supreme Court ruled that Static Control’s claim of violation of the Lanham Act clause falsifying advertisement was valid. The underlying issue in the case was that the Supreme Court had to determine the meaning of the provision by applying the traditional principles of interpreting the statute (Campbell, 2020). The second issue is that labeling the claim by Static Control as a prudential standing question was misleading (Halbert & Ingulli, 2020). Lexmark bases the arguments on the prudential standing of Associated General Contractors. However, the case has strong grounds on statutory provisions that the Supreme Court had to ascertain in terms of statutory interpretation.
The causes of the statute violations damage the plaintiff’s reputation since they fall within the zone of interest covered by the statute. The Supreme Court presumed that the statutory cause of action extended only to plaintiffs for whom the invoked law protects their interests. According to Bennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154, the span of the zone of interest varies depending on the law at issue (Tavares, 2021). The Lanham Act includes statements of purposes such as the people engaged and protection against unfair competition. Common law depicts unfair competition as causing injury to a business’s reputation or sales. The plaintiff must then show that they suffered a commercial interest injury within the zone of interest in a false-advertising suit.
The Supreme Court also presumed that the statutory cause of action is limited to the plaintiff whose injuries arise from the proximate cause of the violation of the statute. For example, in the case of Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U.S. 258-270, the statutory cause of action bars suits from damages that are remote from the defendant’s unlawful conduct (Jones, 2019). However, since the Lanham Act only allows commercial injury lawsuits, the proximate cause of the consumer deception is not fatal as required by the statute.
The principles act as guidance than the direct-competitor test, reasonable interest by the Sixth Circuit, or multifactor balancing test recommended by Lexmark. The principle also outlines that the claims by Static Control fall under plaintiffs authorized to sue under §1125(a). Static Control can sufficiently allege that it lost sales and suffered injuries in its business reputation within the zone of interest caused by Lexmark’s misrepresentation."
"Work
What I Will Do
The sphere of financial well-being directly impacts my physical and psychological health. Visiting a clinic and a psychologist always costs a lot of money, which you need to earn somewhere. My current job does not allow me to take complete care of my health because some services cost as much as half of my salary. Even though I work in a place that allows me to realize myself in the field, I study thoroughly. I want to work where I will have to give no more than a third of my income for various services.
What I Need
To find a better-paying job, I need to do a thorough search for vacancies on various Internet resources. I am not sure that going to the unemployment bureau would be a good idea, but it’s worth considering as an option. It should help me to get to know better the areas in which I can work by taking preparatory courses. It is necessary to approach the preparation of a resume very carefully ( Creating a healthier life , 2016). It is necessary to update it and remove unnecessary things. The resume is my reflection, so it should look appropriate.
Savings
What I Will Do
An essential part of a happy life has a financial cushion to help me cope with difficult times or acquire something significant. Every month, I manage to save a small amount, which helps me travel and not save anywhere. I have a budget for the month, which helps determine how much I should spend this month. Thanks to my new job, I want to increase my expenses for a month to take better care of myself now and in the future.
What I Need
To save money correctly, I should contact the bank to familiarize myself with all the necessary services. Probably, I should open a deposit at a certain percentage so that my amount will grow in any case. Banking applications will allow me to track the movement of my funds better and see where it is worth cutting costs. The new job will have a decisive role in accumulating new funds and their competent expenditure.
Debt
What I Will Do
I would like to have a clear understanding of my total debt and how quickly I can repay it without going beyond my budget. I think that I will be able to figure out this issue myself, without outside help, by carefully studying the information on the Internet. It will help me avoid risks and fraud from the outside, which is my big fear to deal with this issue independently.
What I Need
Many organizations in the world issue microloans that repay debts, but this has a downside. These organizations are taking inhumane measures that it’s time to return the money. A good option is to contact your bank to obtain a credit card with a specific limit. This feature will allow you to pay off most of the debts and, in the future, repay the debt to the bank without haste.
Retirement
What I Will Do
I managed to open a deposit on good terms, and I will constantly try to replenish it with a sufficient amount of funds. Every month I will receive a small percentage of these contributions, which will improve my emotional state. I hope that I will be able to save more and not have to borrow money or take out a loan for another purchase with a new job.
What I Need
To improve my financial well-being even more, I should spend more time studying financial literacy. There are an incalculable number of free resources for training and planning in the modern world. Together, this will give me a happy life where I stop worrying that there is not enough money or I owe someone when everything is under control. Financial control is a very responsible thing you need to start teaching at school."
"The Christian worldview has had a profound influence on the study of Liberal Arts, shaping the way we understand and approach various disciplines. In the readings by Daniel Spanjer, Brad Green, and David Dockery, this influence is explored from different angles, highlighting its impact on philosophy, literature, and higher education.
Firstly, the Christian worldview has shaped the field of philosophy within Liberal Arts. Spanjer, in his essay, emphasizes the integration of faith and reason, where Christians have historically believed that both are necessary for a comprehensive understanding of truth. This viewpoint encourages critical thinking and the exploration of different perspectives, promoting a holistic approach to knowledge. It acknowledges that faith and reason can inform and complement each other, enabling individuals to engage in meaningful dialogue and seek to understand deeper truths.
Secondly, the influence of the Christian worldview on literature is evident. In Green's article, he discusses how Christian beliefs have informed the works of influential authors, contributing to the development of Western literary tradition. Christianity's emphasis on redemption, morality, and human condition has provided a rich source of inspiration for authors, shaping the themes and worldviews present in their works. Additionally, the study of literature from a Christian perspective helps students grapple with fundamental questions about human existence, morality, and the nature of truth.
Lastly, the influence of the Christian worldview on higher education, as discussed by Dockery, demonstrates its impact on curriculum and teaching methodologies. Christian institutions of higher learning integrate faith and learning in a distinct way, emphasizing the integration of biblical principles within various academic disciplines. This approach provides a unique lens through which students can engage with the Liberal Arts, promoting a well-rounded education that cultivates both intellectual growth and spiritual development.
In conclusion, the Christian worldview has significantly influenced the study of Liberal Arts. From philosophy to literature to higher education, its impact is far-reaching and multifaceted. The integration of faith and reason, the exploration of Christian themes in literature, and the distinctive approach to higher education showcase the lasting influence of the Christian worldview in shaping and enriching the study of Liberal Arts. Such a perspective fosters a deeper understanding of the world, encourages critical thinking, and equips students with the ability to engage with complex ideas and diverse perspectives."
"Notably, ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in which the immune system’s abnormal reactions lead to inflammation and ulcers on the inner lining of the large intestine, which is the last part of the GI tract. Based on the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (n.d.), ulcerative colitis can happen at any age; nonetheless, it is more common in people between fifteen and thirty years old. Ulcerative colitis symptoms may differ from person to person, such as diarrhea, passing blood with stool, and abdominal pain. Experts are unsure what causes ulcerative colitis, but they assume genetic factors, abnormal immune responses, the microbiome, and the surroundings play a significant role.
Generally, ulcerative colitis is treated with medications that reduce inflammation in the large intestine and aid in the onset and maintenance of remission. Some people with ulcerative colitis may lose their appetite and eat less; they may not get enough nutrients (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, n.d.). Essentially, a healthy, well-balanced diet is recommended for people who have ulcerative colitis. I would suggest the perfect dinner plate to a client, which includes cooked vegetables, refined grains, lean protein sources, and omega-3 fatty acids (Santos-Longhurst & Watson, 2022). Therefore, I recommend eating asparagus, white rice, and chicken or better fish because it is full of Omega-3. Additionally, I will emphasize that the client should eat sugar-free or unsweetened applesauce for dessert. It is also vital to avoid alcohol and spicy food.
If a patient has celiac disease, I agree that the only treatment is a gluten-free diet. As a result, avoiding gluten for the rest of the patient’s life is critical. Individuals with celiac disease must take special precautions to avoid gluten because it can cause a detrimental response. I would also add that naturally gluten-free foods include beans, chia, millet, quinoa, rice, tapioca, and potato. Essentially, I like your choice of the perfect dinner plate for your patient with celiac disease, consisting of smoked salmon, a kale salad with a balsamic vinaigrette and chopped strawberries, and a side of quinoa. Balsamic vinegar can be used because it is gluten-free; it can also be replaced by grape vinegar. I would recommend adding fortified orange juice or dried figs because of calcium and cashews because they are rich in iron.
Your post is very informative because you mentioned that there are three types of IBS: IBS with constipation (IBS-C), IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), and IBS with both (IBS-M). I liked that you suggested two ideal dinners for patients with IBS-C and IBS-D. IBS-C’s recommended food choices are whole-grain bread and cereals, beans, fruits, and vegetables. Patients with IBS-C should consume foods high in the sugar substitute sorbitol in moderation, such as dried plums and prune juice. You have included prune juice; nonetheless, I would add dried plums as well as a snack. It is crucial to mention that the patient should drink plenty of plain water. When an individual has IBS-D, consume a moderate amount of soluble fiber is vital, such as wheat bread, grain pasta, and dried fruits. Therefore, I would recommend adding dried fruits to the dinner plate. It is crucial to note that patients with IBS-D should avoid drinking water during the meal; water is recommended only an hour before or after the meal."
"Learning history helps people draw connections between the past and present and allows making predictions for the future based on previous lessons. Climate change is one of the most significant topics of interest and research. No matter how well societies develop in terms of technology, they will inevitably face disasters if they neglect the issues of nature. The Chornobyl nuclear accident, which happened in 1986, was one of the most devastating ecological events that changed the fates of thousands of people in many countries.
My prior knowledge of the topic is not ample, but I do know that the major release of radioactive materials occurred, which led to the contamination of air and water, causing numerous diseases and deaths. I have also read somewhere that the then-ruling government of the USSR kept the explosion a secret, which prevented people from saving their lives within the first few hours and days after the accident. Unfortunately, individuals living next to the nuclear plant, as well as those living farther, had no chance of survival. The accident led to the increase in radiation levels to “between ten and one hundred times normal” (Price, 2021, para. 1). I have also read about the courageousness and self-sacrifice of those who were involved in fire extinguishing processes.
I would like to learn more about the reasons that led to such a disaster and to find out whether it was preventable. Also, I want to investigate the reasons behind the decision of the USSR government to conceal the truth and not let people save their lives. I cannot understand how they could have been silent at a time when thousands of citizens were being gradually driven into an ecological trap.
The values, assumptions, and beliefs I have related to the chosen topic are two-dimensional. On the one hand, I am concerned that such catastrophes can occur and harm people’s lives. On the other hand, I am deeply disturbed by the fact that the authorities can act so thoughtlessly and dare to neglect people’s lives. I have always considered freedom and health as the most important values. I believe that world leaders should do everything possible to prevent such disasters or at least not conceal them.
My opinion about the topic is that people should learn from such disasters and use this devastating lesson in the future. However, my perspective is very closely connected to the current world situation. The relevant events happening due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are alarming. In the context of my topic, I should note that a few days ago, Russians attacked Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which is the largest in Europe (Borger & Henley, 2022). Whereas the very question of the Russian invasion of Ukraine is highly tragic and relevant, I will focus on the nuclear plants’ seizure in this paper. Russians seized Chornobyl and Zaporizhzhia nuclear plants, and they seem not to realize what aftermath explosions there could bring.
Sadly, it seems that history has not taught some people anything. After so many deaths in 1986 and following years, one could think that countries of the world had learned the value of people’s health and lives. That is why I want to investigate the topic of the Chornobyl nuclear accident. This way, I will be able to learn more about that disaster and draw conclusions on the present-day threats and the need for preventive measures to stop the possibility of its repetition."
"Introduction:
Mahatma Gandhi, revered as the father of the Indian Nation, is renowned not only for his role in India's struggle for independence but also for his philosophy of nonviolence and moral principles.

"Introduction (100 words):
Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are complex practices that spark heated debates due to their ethical implications. This essay aims to analyze the potential repercussions and impact on individual autonomy and rights from a consequentialist viewpoint. We will consider both the arguments for and against these practices, recognizing that the fundamental ethical question revolves around whether the consequences of these actions outweigh the individual's autonomy and rights.
Body:
1. Arguments for Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide (200 words):
From a consequentialist standpoint, the ethical legitimacy of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide can be justified by examining the potential benefits for terminally ill patients. Proponents argue that it allows individuals to die with dignity, alleviating immense physical and emotional suffering. Moreover, legalized practices can create a regulatory framework to protect patients' autonomy and ensure that only rational requests are fulfilled.
Consequently, the impact on individual rights and autonomy is positive, as personal decisions regarding one's own life are respected. By honoring the patient's will, euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide enhance their right to self-determination, maintaining a person-centered approach to healthcare. Furthermore, legalizing these practices fosters open discussions regarding end-of-life choices, ultimately promoting the values of compassion and empathy in society.
2. Arguments against Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide (200 words):
Critics of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide argue that the potential repercussions outweigh the individual's autonomy and rights. One central concern is the slippery slope argument, suggesting that legalization may lead to a gradual expansion of these practices, encompassing non-terminal illnesses or vulnerable groups. This could result in the erosion of societal safeguards and the manipulation of vulnerable patients.
Moreover, the impact on medical ethics and the doctor-patient relationship cannot be dismissed. Physicians could face ethical conflicts, compromising their Hippocratic Oath to ""do no harm."" The focus on promoting life and providing palliative care may be overshadowed by a system that permits hastened deaths. Critics claim that emphasizing the value and preservation of life is crucial even in the face of suffering, as pain management advancements can often alleviate the patient's distress.
3. Balancing Consequences and Ethical Considerations (200 words):
Finding a balance between the utilitarian consequences and ethical considerations surrounding euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide is essential. Euthanasia should be approached with utmost caution, considering guidelines to prevent potential abuse and ensuring strict individual assessments.
To maintain ethical integrity, the potential risks of the slippery slope must be addressed through robust regulatory frameworks and oversight. Regular evaluations can prevent undue influence, ensuring that only competent individuals with terminal illnesses can avail themselves of these options. Clinicians should receive thorough training, emphasizing the importance of empathy, communication, and respecting the sanctity of life.
Conclusion (100 words):
From a consequentialist perspective, the ethical implications of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide require meticulous analysis. While recognizing the potential benefits for terminally ill patients, we must address concerns about expanding their scope and impact on the doctor-patient relationship. Striking a balance between individual autonomy and societal safeguards is crucial to preserve ethical integrity. Ultimately, by fostering open and respectful discussions, societies can forge a path that respects the dignity of individuals while ensuring the preservation of life and safeguarding against potential abuses."
"Negro spirituals are songs composed by Africans who were abducted and transported to the United States to be sold into slavery. While they were stripped of their languages, families, and culture, their masters could not take away their musical characteristics. A negro spiritual known as Ring Shout uniquely expresses African Christianity. Ring Shout is characterized by hand clapping, footsteps, and other percussion accompanying the lush orchestral singing of the leader and chorus in this folk spiritual. It has a highly stylized religious dance in which participants dance in counter-clockwise circuits (blackhistorywalks 6:24). In the United States, the term “spiritual” is most closely connected with the racial oppression of African Americans. In terms of traditional music, the African American spiritual, also referred to as the Negro Spiritual, is among the most significant and most prominent cultural practices (blackhistorywalks).
A few well-known spirituals are Wallis Willis’ Swing low, dear chariot, and Deep down my heart . (African American Spirituals). The word “spiritual” comes from a King James Bible conversion of Ephesians 5:19: “Speaking to yourself in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs and singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord.” (African American Spirituals). African slaves held “praise houses” and outdoor assemblies titled bush or camp meetings, and brush arbor meetings where they met informally to discuss their conditions of slavery (African American Spirituals). There were ecstatic trances at the gatherings where people would sing, chant and dance.
Enslaved Africans sang about their plight to the American slave lords through the spiritual hymns (blackhistorywalks 5:34). Slave lords let their slaves follow certain Eurocentric religious rituals, even though they did not have the right to free speech. However, they had no idea that a rich culture full of outstanding and complex songs would arise from that, serving as the soundtrack to some people’s spiritual life (blackhistorywalks). Call and response is a crucial feature of negro spirituals. It later found its way into other musical genres, including the blues and gospel. According to Sonia Caldwell in the documentary Origin of the Negro Spiritual (10:20), as a form of resistance, spirituals were used by enslaved people because they wanted to retain African components in their lives. The negro spiritual is sometimes cited as the source of all subsequent musical styles because of its widespread influence.
In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, spirituals played a crucial part in black people’s protests. Spirituals and Gospel songs were essential in the civil rights movements of 1950s and 1960s (African American Spirituals). Majority of the “liberation songs” of the era, such as Eye on the Prize and , Oh Freedom were based on old spirituals. Songs based on spirituals have been used in various countries worldwide, including Russia, East Europe, South Africa, and China. In creating new protest songs, several of today’s best-known pop singers continue to draw inspiration from the spirituals of the past. Songs like Redemption Song by Bob Marley and Billy Bragg’s Sing their souls back home are good examples. Everyone who participated in the ring scream felt a sense of accomplishment and camaraderie after the event. Negro spirituals enabled African-Americans to express their identities and capacities. Because of the prejudice of white superiors who were adverse to the results of the Civil War, Negro Spirituals were also immensely popular amongst African Americans. African Americans discovered a means to deal with their misfortunes through spirituals, which is why Negro Spirituals are considered a part of the African American criterion for American Identity. Negro Spirituals inspired African-Americans to unite and fight for their rights, encouraging them to demonstrate their strength in numbers."

"A lot of historical events and time periods have specific names. The renaissance, the enlightenment, the stone age – all of these were called such for a particular reason, and signify a way to differentiate one era from another. One prime example of that trend is the industrial revolution. Also called the industrialization, it was an important part of history and a big step in both technological and social development. Happening at a never-before seen speed, the process has begun and ended in less than a 100 years. The word “revolution” in “industrial revolution” is used to emphasize that fact, and note that the process is regarded as both an extreme and quick advancement in society ( Industrial revolution ). Like a real revolution, it also had a variety of effects on people and their lives. By changing the way work is performed and understood, it fundamentally shifted the people’s understanding of the economy, labor, and the world itself, driving both positive and negative change.
For entrepreneurs and people starting their own businesses, the industrialization became a central source of focus and income, replacing the manual labor of people. It also created opportunities for new types of production and large scale manufacturing to be performed. The introduction of complex machinery profoundly affected the workers as well, driving the unskilled labor out of fashion and requiring a higher degree of both education and proficiency. Industrial revolution has made many lose their jobs, while a number of other people have gained new possibilities of employment via migrating into cities (Thompson). Industrialization drove urban development, and contributed to the establishment of the city as a central hub for human interaction. On a larger scale, the ability to mass produce goods and services has allowed countries to establish larger economies, expand trade, and start more thorough relationships with their neighbors. Overall, the industrialization age has had its ups and downs, but the significance of the process is hard to overlook, as it remains the basis for the society people see today."
"Organizational culture is an organization’s unique characteristics that set it apart from others in the industry. It manifests itself in values and norms, work ethics, employees’ awareness of themselves and their place in the organization, communications, and human relationships within the team and patients. The development of organizational culture requires the definition of the main overall goal of the organization – the mission, as well as the choice of a strategy for the implementation of this mission. According to Diversicare Healthcare Services (2021), their mission is to improve every life we touch by providing exceptional healthcare and exceeding expectations. To achieve its goals, the organization offers a wide range of high-quality and cost-effective services, improves the composition of qualified personnel in medical centers, and implements cluster activities on a regional basis.
Organizational culture can both facilitate and hinder the implementation of strategic objectives. Correct understanding and use by employees of the organization of goals, values, and models of behavior within the boundaries of the existing organizational culture makes it possible to increase the effectiveness of using the internal resources of a medical organization and minimize costs. Harrison (2020) notes that organizational culture can be effectively used as a management tool with a good knowledge of its capabilities and characteristics. Thus, based on Diversicare’s mission, its strategic priorities are to increase the number of consumers to improve their quality of life, develop services in the country and abroad, and optimize the operational efficiency of services.
Strategic initiatives are intertwined with operational ones during an organization’s activities, forming a complex management system. There are several templates for organizational strategies, and a company may use one of them or combine several mentioned in figure 19.6 (Hillestad and Berkowitz, 2018). For instance, strategic initiatives are usually necessary to ensure an organization’s long-term performance in a competitive environment. In turn, operational activities provide a process for implementing short-term plans and boil down to making decisions in the specific conditions prevailing at the moment. Moreover, these two initiatives have different goals: the operational one maintains the current position and stability, and the strategic management is for development and change. Thus, strategic management, in contrast to an operational one, is designed to ensure the survival of the organization and the achievement of its goals in the long term.
The primary initial resource for the success of strategic initiatives is the staff of the medical organization. The organization’s personnel create organizational competencies and functional characteristics and forms value attitudes. Harrison (2020) affirms that only persons can initiate ideas in an organization, regardless of who they are, an ordinary employee or the organization’s head. According to Diversicare Healthcare Services (2021), the organization should have competent people in the corresponding positions, allowing for consistent structures. Thus, the values of an organization are directly dependent on its structure.
There are a lot of opportunities for Diversicare Healthcare Services Inc. These include population growth and a potential increase in clients, lower interest and tax rates, and improved quality of education, leading to a possible increase in the number of skilled labor. Diversicare Healthcare Services (2021) notes an increase in demand for elderly care services, which can also be singled out as an opportunity. Moreover, Diversicare can expand its activities to other countries, entering their markets. It is essential to constantly analyze the external environment with its inherent legislative, cultural, social, economic, and technological trends to see these opportunities and changes in the process.
Despite significant opportunities for Diversicare, the company faces potential obstacles. According to Diversicare Healthcare Services (2021), these include the inability to fund the vision and strategically manage their finances, the loss of skilled and experienced staff and committee members, the loss of government contracts, changes in funding mechanisms, takeover by a larger organization, and growing needs and consumer expectations. Moreover, one of them is the growing competition from national and international organizations, which can lead to a loss of market share, consumers, and a decrease in income.
To overcome these obstacles for an organization, it is crucial to think strategically across the board. These strategic initiatives include developing, implementing, and overseeing a strategic financial plan, developing a succession plan for the management committee and senior managers, updating recruitment and retention strategies, regularly reviewing the quality plan, and meeting or exceeding all contractual obligations. Furthermore, understanding and tracking the big picture of the care industry, competitive forces, and emerging opportunities, ideas, and initiatives will align with strategic goals and operations."
"Beowulf is an Anglo-Saxon epic poem set in Jutland before the Angles migrated to Britain. The title of this literary work is the name of the main character (Hall 2). Beowulf became one of the revered heroes in Old English literature, and the poem itself had a strong influence on pop culture. This epic character, who accepts his fate without hesitation, attracts attention in modern times full of doubts and contradictions with his almost archetypal clarity and wholeness.
Indeed, for example, it can be assumed that modern superhero comics are particularly popular, partly because people still need the image of a fair, superpowered being. One of the most popular heroes of the Marvel Universe is Superman. Their similarities with Beowulf are obvious – both have incredible strength and are role models for the people of their time (Burn 107). These heroes have to overcome obstacles to help those who need support. In both universes, strength and extreme physical abilities become objects of praise and reverence. In addition, a key factor contributing to the plot of the heroes’ destinies is the presence of an enemy, on whose destruction depends the survival of the world. However, the fundamental difference is that a hero’s physical strength is not enough to admire him for modern people. This characteristic must be complemented by the purity of thought and good intentions. The hero becomes much more complex as the modern world gets more sophisticated.
The fact that people still draw inspiration from old stories correlates with the tenets of postmodernist theory. According to the latter, it is necessary to constantly reproduce what has passed, make sense of it, and experiment with its content. It can be seen that stories about legendary superheroes remain relevant to contemporary viewers, readers, and audiences in general. As in Saxon times, bravery and loyalty are revered, and having these characteristics is what makes an individual a role model."
"Modern city planning studies how people interact with elements of the urban environment and each other. It seeks to determine what a city should be and meet the needs of its inhabitants. The city structure is widely dependent on external factors such as weather conditions, global diseases, and others. The question for urbanists following the results of the coronavirus epidemic is how to make the city resistant to quarantine. The emerging demand conditions the importance of the topic for improving city planning procedures in terms of the pandemic of COVID-19 that hit all major world cities (Kakderi, Oikonomaki, & Papadaki, 2021). Hence, it is vital to elaborate new strategies for more resilient urban design.
There is no environment that would guarantee against infection with the virus. It is essential to imagine how the population moves around the city in urban planning – this is also one of the pandemic lessons. Approximately 95 percent of all cases of COVID-19 in the first months of the spread of infection occurred in cities (Batty, 2020). The pandemic has impoverished another 120 million people, and the quality of life worldwide has declined by 23 percent (Pineda & Corburn, 2020). Throughout the pandemic, local authorities have been responsible for quickly and decisively creating a barrier to the virus. In many places, municipal authorities have coped with this task with honor. People who live without basic amenities become infected more easily and transmit the virus to others (Kakderi et al., 2021). Therefore, it is imperative to create everyday living conditions for citizens, and for this, it is necessary to fight inequality.
Numerous megacities decided to impose restrictions by shutting down restaurants, malls, and other public facilities. In addition, the authorities demanded isolation, which, it seemed, was not an ideal means of fighting infections (Pineda & Corburn, 2020). In order to keep people from social contact, propaganda had to explain that a person is not a friend to a person but a threat to health. On the other hand, public transport could not have been excluded from the proper city functioning. Meanwhile, many cities have relied on a culture of interaction by introducing masks, social distancing, and vaccinations. Citizens’ self-organization, which was highly supported by local authorities, was perhaps the most effective policy in the fight against the pandemic.
Regardless of the measures undertaken, the urban areas have undergone drastic changes since the beginning of the coronavirus epidemic. Numerous businesses went bankrupt and shut down, emptying the streets. What is more, one-fifth of the population moved out to countryside areas seeking more isolation and protection (Pineda & Corburn, 2020). However, there is a positive outcome, too – the city roads have become less congested and contaminated because citizens stopped going out every day.
Even though it is impossible to completely re-plan the city for emergencies, it is necessary to introduce measures to mitigate the probable consequences of a pandemic. For instance, it is worth creating multifunctional residential quarters where all the essential services are within walking distance (Batty, 2020). This strategy will prevent residents from visiting crowded facilities and spreading the virus. Experts have studied the possibility of a layout that will allow commercial and residential buildings to be located nearby, including affordable housing (Lennon, 2021). Such complexes can contribute to improving public health, ecology, and economic development. Increasing the autonomy of housing can significantly reduce the load on urban networks, waste removal and recycling systems, water purification, as well as food production and delivery.
Furthermore, it is indispensable to develop a legally binding spatial and temporal zoning of the urban area and introduce various modes of its use. It should be based on indicators of social distancing, the permissible concentration of people, and the time of their joint stay in the same space (Lennon, 2021). Changing the opening hours of stores and institutions can be another option for simultaneously reducing the concentration of individuals in the same place.
Ultimately, the interaction between representatives of governments, civil society, and the private sector within the framework of a new social contract would be the most successful initiative. Such a contract should provide for the financing of citizens’ basic income, universal medical care, and affordable housing. This strategy could help the vulnerable groups of the population primarily. In case they do not have lodgings, they will be forced to reside in the streets, which can contribute to a broader spread of infection. Hence, this policy is aimed at protecting public health.
In summary, urban planning can be significantly affected by the surge of a pandemic and destroy the infrastructure. Despite the impossibility of preparing the cities for the rise of pandemics, it is still vital to introduce the security measure to be undertaken in case of emergency. This policy should be aimed at reducing the number of people staying in the same place at the same time. In general, the world’s big cities have learned great lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic."

"Introduction (approximately 100 words):
The caster mechanism, although seemingly simple, comprises several intricate components crucial to the smooth movement of objects. In this essay, we will explore the various constituent elements of a caster mechanism and analyze their specific functions. Additionally, we will delve into the materials chosen for each component and examine why they have been selected. Lastly, we will evaluate the individual importance of these components in ensuring the stable and reliable functioning of caster mechanisms.
I. The Different Components of a Caster Mechanism (approximately 200 words):
1. Wheel:
The wheel is the primary component of a caster mechanism responsible for bearing the load and enabling motion. Typically made of materials like rubber, polyurethane, or metal, wheels vary in sizes and designs depending on the intended application. While rubber and polyurethane wheels are better suited for smooth surfaces, metal wheels are preferred for uneven terrains due to their durability and strength.
2. Caster Housing:
The caster housing houses the wheel and acts as a support structure. It is designed to provide stability and robustness to the caster mechanism. Commonly constructed from materials like steel, aluminum, or plastic, the choice of material depends on factors such as load capacity, desired weight, and environmental conditions. Steel housings are advantageous when dealing with heavy loads, whereas plastic or aluminum housings offer advantages in terms of corrosion resistance and lightweight portability.
3. Fork/Caster Yoke:
The fork or caster yoke is the component responsible for connecting the caster wheel to the mounting surface. Typically made from steel or other high-strength materials, the fork ensures a secure attachment between the caster housing and the rest of the apparatus. The design and material choice for the fork depend on the caster's intended use and weight capacity.
II. The Materials Used for Each Component and Why They Were Chosen (approximately 150 words):
The choice of materials for caster components is based on several factors, including load capacity, environmental conditions, cost, and required levels of durability. Steel, owing to its exceptional strength and load-bearing capabilities, is commonly used for caster housings and forks when dealing with heavy objects or rugged environments. Plastic, on the other hand, offers advantages such as corrosion resistance, lightweight construction, and reduced noise during movement. Rubber or polyurethane wheels are often selected due to their impact absorption, traction, and floor protection capabilities. Metal wheels, such as those made from cast iron or steel, provide superior durability and strength, suitable for demanding applications.
III. The Importance of Each Component in Guaranteeing Stable Functioning (approximately 150 words):
Each component within the caster mechanism plays a crucial role in ensuring the stable functioning of the overall system. The wheel's design and choice of material influence load capacity, maneuverability, and floor protection. The caster housing, by providing support and stability, prevents the wheel from buckling under heavy loads. The fork or caster yoke ensures the proper connection between the wheel and the mounting surface, guaranteeing secure attachment and smooth movement. The absence or failure of any one component can lead to inefficiency, increased risk of accidents, or reduced lifespan of the caster mechanism.
Conclusion (approximately 50 words):
In essence, understanding the different components of a caster mechanism and their functions is vital in comprehending the intricate simplicity of its operations. The choice of appropriate materials for each component is crucial for optimizing performance, while the significance of every constituent part in guaranteeing stable functioning cannot be overstated."
"There are many different scientific approaches to language studies; one of them is the prescriptive method. This principle can generally be described as a set of rules that prescribe speaking or writing. Crystal (1987) notes that prescriptivism is a perspective that chooses one of the interpretations of a language as the standard and extends it to the entire society. This variation is most often found in formal speech and literature. An alternative perspective is a descriptive approach based not on standards but on the actual situation. The proponent of this method simply describes the facts of linguistic variousness (Crystal, 1987). They act as an observer, not constrained by the official framework.
Although these methods are opposite in meaning, each of them can be applied in the appropriate context. Crystal (1987) notes that exploring these methods often leads to an unrealistic depiction of the opposite side, the formation of prejudice and confrontation. However, both approaches should exist together, combining the positive aspects of each other. While the prescriptive approach allows the design of society to be arranged, the descriptive approach allows the recording of real language changes (Crystal, 1987). This, in turn, allows combining logic and the natural order of things.
However, not all language changes are received positively due to misconceptions. The clearest example is the belief that change means deterioration, as the old generation constantly complains (Crystal, 1987). In addition, language changes are associated with a decline in the quality of education and the negative impact of the media. Nevertheless, the author selects sufficient counterarguments to all these fears. The elders are always resentful of change, as evidenced by historical correspondence. Deterioration in the quality of education and social tension arises only if these changes occur abruptly.
Nevertheless, such cases are extremely rare, so I agree with these comments. As Crystal (1987) points out, it is common for the older generation to dislike the modern world, as evidenced by the literature. The influence of the media and the quality of education is not always necessarily linked to direct language changes. Therefore, my support for this position is based on the fact that people are usually afraid of change. Most people need the consistency of developed habits and methods in life. However, language change is a natural process that is not subject to official structures and is formed together with society and its most progressive members."
"Introduction
Peoples’ behaviors and decisions are often the central scope of sociological inquiry. Flint (Michigan) water crisis can be seen as an illustration of such decisions and behaviors that have led to severe issues with multiple implications. To understand the causes of the crisis and ways to prevent such problems in the future, it is possible to employ the Marxist approach. The class concept of this paradigm best fits into the analysis of the situation as a conflict between two major groups is apparent.
Flint (Michigan): Demographics
In the middle of the twentieth century Flint (Michigan) was a rapidly developing and prosperous city that hosted such giants as General Motors. However, in the 1980s, the town started to degrade due to the severe oil crisis that hit the automotive industry (Pauli, 2020). The city saw tremendous demographic shifts because thousands of people left searching for better employment and living conditions. At present, the city’s population is slightly over 96 thousand people (Data USA, 2021). The majority of residents are Black, and a third is White. The poverty rate is relatively high and reached 39% in 2020, while the median age is quite low (35,5 years). These figures suggest that the socio-economic situation in Flint is alarming, and significant changes are needed.
Water Crisis in Flint (Michigan)
The crisis started in 2014, and officials in collaboration and supervision of the public and scientists could not solve it until 2019. In 2014, officials had to change the water source due to the difficulties with maintaining the existing infrastructure (Krings et al., 2018). No rapid measures to improve the infrastructure were implemented. The same year, people addressed officials due to their dissatisfaction with water quality, which remained unattained. After several studies and data publications regarding extreme violation of water quality standards (high lead level, harmful bacteria), the officials were forced to take action. As a result, pipes were replaced, and the necessary improvement to the infrastructure was made with the help of the federal budget funds.
Water Crisis in Flint (Michigan): Causes
One of the central issues that caused the crisis was the city’s constraints related to infrastructure. Flint’s budget could hardly ensure proper maintenance of pipes and other infrastructure components (Pauli, 2020). Due to the economic situation in the city, the public had less control over the actions and decisions of an emergency manager and Governor Rick Snyder. Residents addressed the authorities, but their claims received little attention as the authorities concentrated on the economic development of the city rather than public health or safety.
Flint Water Crisis: Social Concept Applied
When addressing the causes of the crisis, it is necessary to apply the concept of class. Although various scholars note that class is a subjective construct created for analytical purposes, this notion is a relevant component of population stratification (Neilson, 2017). People identify with a particular group, such as workers (proletariat) or big business owners (bourgeoisie). In Flint, this stratification is relevant as there is almost no middle class. Apparently, officials concentrated on the needs of big businesses rather than workers.
Marxist Theory: Class
According to the Marxist theory of class, human society is mainly divided into the proletariat (laborers) and bourgeoisie (those who usurp laborers’ resources). The former are working people with little resources as they are taken over by the rich (Neilson, 2017). These two groups are in constant conflict, and their resolution can be achieved by revolution. The revolution can be implemented peacefully in terms of the coalition with a part (minority) of bourgeois and proletariat or due to violent struggle. Marx believed in the victory of the proletariat and the establishment of communism with its justice and proper distribution of resources.
Marxist Perspective Regarding the Crisis
In the situation in Flint, the officials took the side of the bourgeoisie, paying no attention to potential outcomes. Authorities made some decisions to allocate funds to boost the development of the economy supporting business. However, the proletariat was the class deprived of higher living standards as poor people had to live in older communities with old water pipes contaminated considerably. Water was the resource that became central to the conflict between the two classes. Proletariat won the struggle, which could be explained by the success of the peaceful revolution with the coalition of workers and some part of business owners.
Marxist Perspective Regarding the Crisis (Social Concepts)
The discussion of the crisis from the Marxist theory of class perspective makes it possible to take a closer look at such concepts as civil society and race. Civil society is regarded as a construct bringing society to balance and ensuring that all groups’ interests are addressed (Neilson, 2017). Race is another social concept that can be applied as most of the city’s residents are Black. The poverty rate in this population is also the highest (Data USA, 2021). This group has the lowest access to proper living conditions (good neighborhoods), employment, and health care. This is the most vulnerable group that was the primary force empowering the civil society, which led to considerable improvements and crisis resolution.
The Crisis from Bourdieu’s Perspective
The Flint water crisis can be viewed from Bourdieu’s perspective based on the idea that classes are analytical constructs. Instead, different groups, with individuals joining and leaving these clusters, collaborate or find themselves in a conflict. There was no clear-cut working class in Flint, and the big business struggled for resources. However, workers, unemployed people, small business owners, big business owners, officials, scientists, and others were communicating and collaborating. These interactions helped the groups solve an issue that had adverse effects on all of them.
Conclusion
Marxist and Bourdieu’s perspectives can be both applied to analyze the Flint Water crisis. It becomes clear that classes are objective constructions, although they are not clear-cut. Workers, entrepreneurs, big business owners, merchants, scientists, and employees have diverse interests, and they may sometimes be in conflict. However, the needs of people pertaining to different groups can be achieved by collaborating. The Flint Water Crisis is an illustration of the conflict and its resolution. Although the focus was initially on the interest of businesses and economic growth at the expense of public health, people managed to force officials to make the right choices and address the water issue. The representative of different classes and clusters of society formed the civil society that became the power bringing the solution. The authorities had to implement appropriate measures to solve the problem. It is clear that civil society can be a supervisory force to ensure that officials make proper decisions."
"In Niccolo Machiavelli's renowned work, ""The Prince,"" he boldly challenges traditional ideas of politics and human nature. Machiavelli presents a ruthless and pragmatic approach to governance that shatters longstanding notions of moral virtue and emphasizes the pursuit of power at any cost.
Traditionally, politics held a strong association with moral values and ethical principles. Leaders were expected to embody virtuous qualities, leading their states with integrity and compassion. However, Machiavelli's ""The Prince"" challenges this notion by asserting that rulers should prioritize self-interest and use any means necessary to maintain power and stability. Machiavelli argues that it is better for a leader to be feared than loved if they want to retain control over their state. This departure from traditional ideas underscores the pragmatic reality of power politics.
Furthermore, Machiavelli also confronts conventional views on human nature. Historically, it was assumed that individuals are inherently good and that leaders should govern in a manner that elicits the best in their citizens. However, ""The Prince"" suggests that humans are inherently self-interested and driven by their own desires. Machiavelli believes that leaders must acknowledge this reality and act accordingly to secure their positions. This challenging perspective raises profound questions about the nature of humanity and the feasibility of idealistic governance.
By discarding traditional ideas of politics and human nature, Machiavelli's ""The Prince"" revolutionizes political theory. He argues that rulers should prioritize power and stability over moral considerations and that human nature is driven by self-interest rather than benevolence. Machiavelli's ideas provoke discomfort and controversy as they challenge centuries of entrenched belief systems. However, they also offer valuable insights into the realities of politics and the complexities of human behavior.
In conclusion, Machiavelli's ""The Prince"" challenges traditional ideas of politics and human nature by advocating for a ruthless and pragmatic approach to governance. He dismisses the association of politics with moral virtue and emphasizes the pursuit of power at any cost. Machiavelli also confronts the notion of inherent human goodness, suggesting that individuals are driven by their own self-interest. Although his ideas are controversial, they provoke important reflections on the nature of politics and human behavior."
"In the film Every Secret Thing, the complex emotional attachment between Alice and her mother plays a pivotal role in shaping the events that unfold, including the kidnappings and murders. The mother complex and the mother archetype are central to understanding the dynamics of their relationship and the impact it has on the characters' actions.
Alice has a deeply embedded mother complex, which refers to the unconscious emotions and desires a person has towards their mother figure. She idolizes her mother, Helen, constantly seeking her approval and attention. This complex leads Alice to develop a dependent and intense attachment towards her mother, making her susceptible to manipulation and coercion. Helen, on the other hand, embodies the mother archetype – an idealized image of nurturing and unconditional love. However, beneath this façade, Helen is distant and neglectful, failing to meet Alice's emotional needs.
The mother complex and the mother archetype contribute to the unhealthy nature of Alice and Helen's relationship. Alice's unmet emotional needs drive her desire for attention, leading her to commit acts of violence to gain her mother's notice. She views the kidnappings as a way to bring her mother closer and draw out the love she yearns for. This desire is further fueled by the mother archetype that society imposes on Helen, perpetuating the notion that a mother should unconditionally love her child. Alice believes that by involving her mother in the search for the missing children, she will finally receive the affection she desires.
Furthermore, the mother complex also affects Alice's perception of herself. She internalizes her mother's neglect as a reflection of her own unworthiness. Alice believes that her actions will make her deserving of her mother's love and attention. Combined with the power of the mother archetype, Alice's distorted self-perception fuels her involvement in the kidnappings and subsequent murders.
Ultimately, the complex emotional attachment between Alice and her mother leads to a series of tragic events. The yearning for maternal love, combined with distorted self-perception and societal pressures, drives Alice to commit heinous acts. The overwhelming influence of the mother complex and the mother archetype highlights the profound impact a mother's absence or neglect can have on an individual's psyche and actions.
In conclusion, the complex emotional attachment between Alice and her mother greatly contributes to the unfolding events in Every Secret Thing. The mother complex and the mother archetype play central roles in shaping their relationship dynamic and driving Alice's actions. The film serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of healthy maternal relationships and the damaging consequences of unresolved emotional needs."
"Reliability is vital in research because it ensures consistency in the data collected and the research techniques employed. When data collection methods are consistent, it becomes easier for researchers to replicate the study and obtain similar outcomes. Consistency helps establish the credibility and generalizability of research findings. Consider a study investigating the relationship between study time and academic performance. If students’ study time is measured inconsistently, with some participants reporting daily study hours while others report weekly study hours, the findings may be flawed. In this case, the lack of reliability in the data collection method hinders trust in the study's conclusions.
Furthermore, reliability also refers to the internal consistency of research instruments. For example, if a questionnaire is used to measure participants’ motivation levels, it should yield consistent results when administered multiple times. Ensuring a strong internal consistency of research instruments enhances the validity of the study because it indicates that the measurement is reliable and accurate.
Validity, on the other hand, focuses on the accuracy and factualness of research data and instruments. It aims to establish that the measurement tools accurately reflect the phenomenon being studied. If the data collected lacks validity, the findings may not truly reflect the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. For instance, if a researcher wants to measure the impact of a new teaching method on students' performance and uses an exam to assess this relationship, the exam questions must align with the key concepts of the teaching method. If the questions are unrelated or fail to assess relevant knowledge, the validity of the study's conclusions is compromised.
To ensure validity, researchers employ various methods including content validity, criterion-related validity, and construct validity. Content validity ensures that the measurement tool captures the full range of the construct being studied. Criterion-related validity examines the correlation between the research instrument and an external criterion. Construct validity assesses whether the measurement tool adequately represents the theoretical construct of interest. All these validity measures are crucial in allowing researchers to draw accurate and meaningful conclusions.
In conclusion, the importance of reliability and validity in research cannot be overstated. Through consistency and accuracy, reliability and validity contribute to sound research methodology and meaningful findings. Reliability ensures consistency in data collection and research techniques, while validity ensures accuracy and factualness in research instruments and data. Researchers must pay careful attention to these characteristics to ensure the trustworthiness and applicability of their research findings."
"Introduction
Coordination in healthcare is a critical activity supporting healthcare’s efficient and successful transmission. Healthcare regulations, ethical resource development, and many other essential aspects of healthcare should be considered while coordinating treatment for patients. Care coordination also considers a patient’s psychological requirements, cultural viewpoint, ethics, and other specific features that provide satisfaction throughout the treatment process. A selected patient’s hypertension will be examined, and a tentative care coordination plan prepared to address the patient’s needs. Hypertension is a condition in which blood pressure is greater than it should be. Nearly 50% of the US population from around 54 to 74 years has hypertension (Carey & Whelton, 2018). Thus, a coordinated care plan will benefit the patient and anybody else who may be affected by the condition. The number of instances of hypertension has risen, and the primary reason is people’s lifestyles.
Patient-Centered Health Interventions
Effective interventions should place the patient at the heart of the treatment and clinical endeavors. Patient-centered care entails including the patient in the treatment process and taking an active role. Patients may make a significant difference in the quality of healthcare they get if they are adequately involved (Fowler, 2017). The patient in this study was a 65-year-old woman diagnosed with hypertension in July 2019. The important statistics are BP 141/90, HR 108 bpm, temperature 38 °C, and RR 37 bpm. When the patient learned about her illness, she became interested in care coordination and made the plan better and faster. She stated that she was eager to learn more about the disease and what she could do to maintain a normal life despite having a disability. Her hypertension would cause several health problems; thus, it was critical to point out three of them.
Stroke or Heart Attack
A heart attack can occur because of the hardening and thickening of the arteries caused by hypertension (atherosclerosis). It is common knowledge that a heart attack happens when there is a blockage of blood flow to the heart, resulting in a blood clot formation. A stroke is a similar obstruction of blood flow but affects the brain (Wang et al., 2018). They do, nevertheless, follow a similar pattern, and patients with high blood pressure should be on the lookout for any of these health problems since they are more likely to occur.
The best ways to prevent heart problems for the patient in question include quitting smoking and drinking alcohol, getting enough exercise, managing their blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and losing or maintaining their current weight. With the support of a medical coordination cooperation team, the patient can accomplish this. Another way to improve this is to incorporate a shared resource to provide the patient with more information about their treatment options (Wang et al., 2018). Health Partners Regional Hospital, Mayo Clinic, and University of Minnesota Medical Center are excellent community resources.
Depression
Learning about hypertension might significantly affect a patient’s mental and emotional health. Because this is a long-term ailment, the patient will need to alter her lifestyle and spend a significant amount of money to guarantee that she receives the best possible treatment (Fowler, 2017). All of these things may take a toll on the patient. Depression is a serious problem because its symptoms and indications might be mistaken for those of other medical conditions.
In the treatment of depression, patient-centered interventions include ensuring that the patient maintains her daily activities, uses medication when symptoms appear, educates the patient about depression, and gets the patient’s social circle more involved in her overall health and well-being (Wang et al., 2018). The University of Minnesota Medical Center, Mayo Clinic, psychiatric hospitals, the Minnesota Department of Human Services, and other community services might be consulted if a patient suffers from depression.
Dementia
Blocked arteries cause vascular dementia, and constricted arteries hinder blood flow to the brain. Strokes are thought to be a contributing factor in people developing dementia. Cognitive decline is one of the hallmarks of dementia (decline in memory, problem-solving skills, and language) (Fowler, 2017). Patients with high blood pressure should know that poor health and lifestyle decisions can lead to dementia, a chronic and progressive disease.
Workouts, multisensory stimulation, and medication are all examples of patient-centered therapies (pharmacology). Reminiscence, reassurance, and aromatherapy are some of the methods used to treat those with dementia (Wang et al., 2018). The Minnesota Guardians Pharmacy, the University of Minnesota Medical Center, and the Mayo Clinic are among the local community services that can assist patients in dealing with dementia.
Ethical considerations in patient-centered healthcare interventions
Healthcare has a crucial role in upholding ethical standards and should be performed following moral principles. According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), patient-centered treatment includes ethical considerations as a core component (Fowler, 2017). This includes making sure that patients are treated with respect and consideration at all times. American Nurses Association’s (ANA) Code of Ethics encourages nurses to guarantee that they adhere to their professional standards. The ethical principles of healthcare delivery, such as benevolence, independence, nonmaleficence, and impartiality, are crucial criteria for ensuring that treatment is provided ethically. Improving care coordination is made possible by ethical and moral healthcare practices.
When it comes to caring coordination, ethical questions arise and are critical, such as whether the patient’s well-being has been considered. Additionally, whether care coordination has improved patient safety and healthcare quality is another matter (Wang et al., 2018). Team members might reflect on what they would have achieved if the problem had been more personal (maybe to a family member or friend). Quality care and patient outcomes may be ensured if concerns are dealt with ethically, and the patient is given the finest treatment available.
Continuity and Coordination of Care in Health Policy
Health policies play a critical role in ensuring that healthcare is ethical and compliant with applicable laws. Health policy should also consider ethical deliberations, a critical part of the care integration strategy. The government and the organizations established to monitor and operationalize healthcare operations set health policies. They are designed to ensure that healthcare goals are met quickly and effectively (Wang et al., 2018). The Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare after President Barack Obama, who advocated for its passage, is a major healthcare policy. Regardless of how it is perceived, the law has had a substantial influence on the process of care coordination and continuity.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a regulation that controls patient information privacy and insurance coverage for health care services under its purview. It aims to make healthcare more accessible to more people, regardless of where they live in the country or where the federal government has authority over them at any one moment. A multidisciplinary approach, trust, and privacy in care coordination make it possible for patients to share their private medical information with a wide range of specialists (Hu et al., 2018). HIPAA guarantees that care coordination uses patient data in the most effective manner possible.
Both Obamacare and HIPAA assure patient assistance in times of need. Hypertension may significantly influence patients, and they should obtain the best available care (Hu et al., 2018). Additionally, the Care Continuum and Coordination Act improves patient care by allowing them to continue receiving healthcare services for a given time. Effective health policy provisions are important tools if a patient is nearing the end of their life and cannot pay for treatment.
Priorities a Care Coordinator Would Introduce
Learning sessions are essential to improve care coordination. The best method to implement a care coordination strategy is to provide patients with regular educational opportunities (Liang et al., 2017). These opportunities will assist patients in grasping the need for care coordination better. Many key aspects of the patient’s care coordination plan were emphasized. We effectively coordinated and dealt with the difficulties that developed because of the uncovered concerns, ensuring that the care continuum was done in the manner intended by the appropriate parties.
As a care coordinator and healthcare provider, I learned how to attend to patients’ needs in partnership with them. In addition, I gained insight into the hopes and concerns of patients and the areas where they believed the healthcare continuum might require improvement. The patient made it clear that she was aware of the importance of the continuum of treatment. The coordination strategy allowed her to gather crucial information that she would not have otherwise accessed. However, it was clear that some aspects of the care plan needed improvement.
Close people, such as family members, should be encouraged to attend the sessions by the patient. Consequently, improved care coordination is achieved even in the patient’s own home. Care coordination practices will benefit nutritionists, fitness coaches, and other professionals in physiotherapy and occupational therapy (Liang et al., 2017). Because of such adjustments, the final care plan would be revised and implemented. Increasing the number of learning sessions will benefit everyone, but it would be especially beneficial to hypertension patients. Changes based on evidence-based practice should be intended to ensure that care is delivered quickly and efficiently.
Plan for Patient Care and Healthy People 2030
In the treatment process and the care coordination plan, patient happiness is the most important goal for all parties. The patient in this study expressed her happiness with the treatment process because of the learning sessions, which incorporated patients in the care process. The progress made in achieving Healthy People 2030 is fully documented in the care strategy. According to Healthy People 2030, healthcare conditions such as hypertension are of international importance and should be treated per the organization’s recommendations (Hasbrouck, 2021). The management of respiratory disorders would be incomplete without care coordination.
The adjustments recommended should be incorporated into the final collaborative care plan to ensure patient fulfillment in line with Healthy People 2030. Alternative learning approaches should also be considered to alleviate the stereotypes and dullness sometimes associated with education and make it more enjoyable for all parties involved (Liang et al., 2017). Including all stakeholders in the care process will help raise awareness and address underlying issues. This may be incorporated into a healthcare management plan for various conditions.
Conclusion
Doctors and patients should work together to guarantee long-term success and improve the quality of life. Ingenious alternatives should be offered to bring much-needed diversity to the integrated treatment strategy. Healthy People 2030 principles and ethical behaviors have been suggested as part of a healthcare strategy. Incorporating adjustments and ensuring the patient is an active participant in the treatment process can improve care provision and patient outcomes."
"When discussing Parkinson’s Disease (PD), the patient’s care, both from the community and healthcare professionals, is a concern. Therefore, my topic of interest is the care and treatment of people suffering from PD and how their lives could be improved. I chose this topic because it is empathetic seeing patients struggling independently without proper care from the community and the healthcare. The topic is a matter of concern because helping the vulnerable in the community creates an inclusive environment for all. Moreover, caring for PD patients is a health concern issue because, without proper intervention, patients suffering from this condition could develop worse conditions and adversely affect their lives. I believe that PD is treatable, and patients put under proper medication show minimal difficulties coping with their lives. In researching the topic, the keywords to use are ‘appropriate caring for patients with Parkinson’s Disease, which yields a variety of nursing journals to choose from.
  * P – Patients and people affected by Parkinson’s Disease (PD).
  * I – How does collaborative care and disease education helps to improve care management among patients who have Parkinson’s Disease? Is it worth educating members of society about PD? And what effects could it bring to patients suffering from this condition?
  * C – Compares to patients’ data with no collaborative care and victims surrounded by uninformed people about the disease.
  * O – Improves PD patients’ care management and care in general.
  * T – Over a 24-week time frame.
For the sustainability of this project, it is important to provide supporting evidence on the importance of collaborative and disease education among the community members. Therefore, I intend to exhaust several nursing journals concerning caring for people and patients with Parkinson’s Disease. The targeted nursing journals whose content presents the importance of PD education and studies promoting collaborative care for these victims. This project aims primarily to prove the importance of PD education and the need for awareness of this condition in the community. Finally, at the end of the specified period, the behaviors and the ease of coping with the condition among PD patients will be compared with stored data when the community was not informed of the PD. Therefore, there is a high expectation of a positive result regarding efficient care and ease in managing PD patients.
My research concerning PD patients’ care continues as I found this article as important as the two discussed articles. This article’s main point is shifting care of the PD patients from hospitals to community care. According to Aye et al. (2020), integrated multidisciplinary care in collaboration with other healthcare professionals is the key to managing PD patients and their conditions. Moreover, the article presents insufficient expertise, poor interdisciplinary collaboration, and communication to deliver care to PD patients as the core challenges facing the shifting process. Since full shifting to community patient-centric care would be difficult, the research proposes programs such as PD training and Telemedicine to make the dream true shortly (Aye et al., 2020). This article further narrows down and points out the role of multidisciplinary care in PD and the limitations exhibited by PD patients in the community. This research was based on Singapore’s PD model of care. According to Aye et al. (2020), PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, as the research found that more than 6000 people are diagnosed with the disease. Hence over congestion of PD patients forced the birth of Patient-Centric Care outside the hospitals.
In my opinion, I found this source biased as caring for persons suffering from PD is concerned. The article does not explain the programs that ensure that these patients receive the utmost care outside the hospitals. Moreover, without proper education and the provision of Telemedicine, many homes that care for PD patients would have a hard time as they do not receive quality care. However, I agree with moving PD care from hospitals to the community because various hospitals do not have sufficient facilities to handle the figures quoted in the case of Singapore. In doing so, caregivers and other healthcare professionals find it easy to care for patients with adverse PD conditions. Reading the article gives insights and knowledge of PD and the reason for ultimate patient care. With the increased PD condition, this matter is a nursing situation and a global matter of concern to help reduce and care for these vulnerable.
Therefore, it is important to note that all three discussed articles build on the consensus that persons diagnosed with PD deserve the utmost care to better their lives. The three articles agree that PD is a chronic neurodegenerative disease with complex motor and non-motor symptoms. Moreover, the articles have stressed the importance of caring for caregivers and the community. The articles also give insights into how PD persons and their families could be supported to better their existence in the community. A good example is teaching programs in the community. This creates PD awareness in the community and enhances patients’ care knowledge. Although the articles agree on some aspects concerning PD patient care, the second article dwells on the relationship between educating the public on PD and the burden of caregiving. The finding showed that with education on the PD, patients receive quality care and reduce the burden on the caregivers’ side. All in all, the information gained from these articles teaches the importance and the need for PD patients’ care.
This article primarily presents the concept of personalized care management for persons affected by Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Furthermore, this article acknowledges PD as one of the rising neurodegenerative disorders in the world, affecting more than eight million people globally (Halteren, Munneke, Smit, Thomas, Bloem & Darweesh, 2020). Hence, collaborative care among families, health professionals, and healthcare services is necessary for providing care for these groups of people to make life easier for patients diagnosed with PD. The article has proposed a personalized care management model for these vulnerabilities in making this dream true. According to Hatteren et al. (2020), the model proposed has five elements for helping PD patients cope with their condition.
The first is care coordination which could be termed a team-based activity. The element allows sharing of health information among the caregivers hence facilitating a common understanding. The second element in this model is patient navigation, which involves integrated service delivery to guide and support both the caregivers and the patients. The research also found that fragmentation of care among these patients immensely affects the quality of service received. The third element as per the model is information provision data sharing concerning both physical and health details of the PD patients. Teaching PD patients about their condition creates self-awareness and, in turn, results in self-management and active self-decision-making. The fourth element of the model is the early detection of signs and symptoms through proactive monitoring. This involves thorough monitoring of patients suspected of developing PD conditions so that timely intervention can prevent further worsening. Finally, the last element of the personalized care management model is process monitoring. The element mainly involves tracking, reviewing, and evaluating the care management process concerning set plans and goals. The process is essential because it assesses the quality-of-service deliveries and their impact on the PD’s patients.
This is a useful source to start with as far as PD patients are concerned. Reading through this article provides important insights both for caregivers and the family living with persons diagnosed with PD. For instance, I personally, through reading the article, find it necessary to support families and patients struggling to handle these persons living with PD, and in the future, I am looking forward to helping families and individuals affected directly or indirectly by PD. Moreover, I would support the reliability of this source because it still publishes articles today. The information contained in this article was objective and had a clear message concerning caring for the persons affected by PD and proved that caring for PD patients is a matter that deserves nursing attention.
This is another article that I found interesting as PD is concerned. The article starts by appreciating the role of disease education in managing PD. This research aimed to bring up the link that exists between understanding disease and the burden of care. According to Lee et al. (2019), Parkinson’s Disease is a neurodegenerative disease that lowers the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. This research also says that patients on active medication do not find difficulty living with the situation. The biggest problem that the article brings out is identifying the signs and symptoms of PD. It says caregivers find it difficult to recognize early signs and symptoms of a PD condition. For future accuracy, the research calls for education on the disease. For instance, a study of the Patient Education Program for PD (PEPP) reinstated the need to educate caregivers and patients diagnosed with PD (Lee et al., 2019). Thus, education programs on the disease improved the understanding of patients and caregivers of the PD and reduced the burden of care, and improved the quality of life among PD patients.
In my opinion, this article is a useful source, just like the first one. Caring for PD patients demands that all caregivers, including family members, be informed about the condition to reduce their anxieties.
Therefore, I support the research findings that education programs are necessary to provide a quality understanding of PD conditions. Moreover, I agree and support that caregiving among non-informed patients was met with difficulties instead of patients who were informed of their conditions. The research was carried out on 142 patients, of which both male and female patients were part. The findings could be used as a representative sample regardless of the geographical area. Thus, as the article presents, PD care is a challenge to caregivers and the whole community; as such, education on the disease must be a top priority to enhance the understanding of PD conditions."
"Firstly, the pandemic has severely limited access to traditional exercise facilities such as gyms, fitness centers, and community recreational areas. The closure of these spaces has forced individuals to find alternative ways to exercise, which may not always be convenient or feasible for everyone. Reduced opportunities for organized sports and group activities have also contributed to a decline in physical activity levels.
Moreover, the increased reliance on technology and remote work or learning arrangements has resulted in a more sedentary lifestyle for many individuals. With more time spent indoors and less physical movement incorporated into daily routines, the risk of physical inactivity and related health issues has escalated. Studies have shown that prolonged sitting can lead to various health problems, including obesity, heart disease, and musculoskeletal disorders.
Despite these challenges, maintaining an active lifestyle is crucial during the pandemic for several reasons. Firstly, regular physical activity helps strengthen the immune system, reducing the risk of contracting respiratory infections. Engaging in moderate-intensity exercise for at least 150 minutes per week has been shown to enhance immune function, offering protection against viral illnesses. As COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory system, it is paramount to maintain a strong immune system during this time.
Secondly, physical activity plays a vital role in managing stress and mental health. The pandemic has brought forth a surge in anxiety, depression, and feelings of isolation. Engaging in regular exercise releases endorphins, which act as natural mood elevators and stress relievers. Furthermore, physical activity provides a sense of routine and purpose, combating the negative psychological effects of social restrictions.
Lastly, staying physically active during the pandemic promotes overall well-being and creates a healthy lifestyle. Regular exercise aids in weight management, improves cardiovascular health, and enhances cognitive function. By incorporating physical activity into our daily routines, we can reduce the risk of chronic diseases and maintain optimal health.
In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted physical activity globally. Despite the challenges faced, it is crucial to maintain an active lifestyle during this time. Regular exercise strengthens the immune system, supports mental well-being, and helps prevent chronic diseases. As we adapt to new norms and restrictions, prioritizing physical activity will not only benefit our individual health but also contribute to building a healthier, more resilient society."
"Treating people is a difficult job, and even the most competent doctor will not manage to do it alone. Nurses are an essential link in the work of the medical system and the process of saving the lives of the population. Thinking about my past, I find events that led me to the profession of nurse. The people’s experience significantly forms their character and thoughts, which determines many life choices (Woźniak, 2019). My experience in various circumstances helped me realize my vocation. These situations in my life may seem ordinary, but for me, they have become pivotal and those that prove that all events are not coincident at all.
Issues of difficulties and challenges people face, for instance, global problems and similar concerns, have occupied my mind since childhood. I kept wondering what could be done to change something. In response, thoughts arise about changing the world, environmental protests, the invention of technologies that will save the ocean. However, although these activities are critical, they seemed unsuitable for my character, and I wanted to do something more practical and influential. These thoughts are the first reason that led me to the profession of nurse. For me medicine and care change the world for the better. Moreover, without them, humanity would have never reached the modern standard of living. Changing the lives of even one patient for the better is also important as changing the whole world.
Many of us had some experience of illness and even being in hospitals in childhood. Such a situation happened to me – I had to stay in the medical center for treatment for several days. Being a child, I was terrified and worried, especially at night. However, there was a nurse who managed to calm me down and support me. She even let me call her by her name, Tina, and I felt that we became friends. I always recalled her with joy, and when I grew up, I realized how valuable and important her actions were for a little child. This situation was the second reason that led me to the profession of a nurse – I understood that there are many people in the world who, like me then, need the same support and comfort, and I can give them.
We have to deal with diseases and injuries not only in hospital conditions but also in emergencies in any circumstances. Family members, friends, and even strangers may suddenly become ill or injured, and it is necessary to take action quickly – after all, saving a life can depend on a few seconds. As a teenager, I witnessed my friend break his arm. We were lucky, and there was a person nearby who could provide aid, and the ambulance reached quickly. However, for a few minutes, I felt helpless and confused – I strived to help but did not want to harm. This event was another reason that prompted me to decide to become a nurse. First aid skills, and even simple help in measuring pressure, can be life-saving.
Thus, several important events and long reflections when making decisions are behind my decision to become a nurse. I see many advantages in the work of nurses and believe in their particular importance. Saving lives and giving comfort and care to many people is what I want to do. Kindness, attentiveness, and support are what our world needs, and these features can bring wellbeing to the population."
"The emergence of information society has sparked the further creation of multiple opportunities for revisiting the current sociocultural, socioeconomic, and sociopolitical issues. Specifically, the problem of inequities in the modern community has been established as one of the primary global concerns (Chakravartty 298). In turn, civil society organizations as the bodies that seek to address the presence of injustice have been applying additional effort to manage the observed injustice. According to the World Summit on Information Society (WSIS), the post-colonial context must be clearly understood in order to build policies based on the concept of equity.
A similar sentiment is expressed in Aginam’s essay, where the author introduces an example of a situation that requires the force of WIS to address the problem of inequity. Specifically, according to Aginam, the focus on the transcultural economy and involvement of a greater range of global participants into the trade process will allow leveraging some of the existing inequalities (247). Specifically, by seeking partnerships and business expansion opportunities with foreign communities, one will be able to focus on building socioeconomic equality and raise the voices of the victims of colonialism.
The idea of supporting minority countries in the post-colonial economy with the help of WSIS and the related organizations appears to be quite promising. However, ensuring that the actions taken by the involved parties are based solely on the principles of ethics and diversity suggests introducing practical control tools. For this reason, creating a global communication channel for post-colonial communities will be necessary."
"Overview
Because of its restricted comprehension and connection with other essential occupations in the professional industry, athletic training may be perplexing to many people, irrespective of the sector. The athletic trainer, like fitness and endurance instructors, efficiency experts, physiotherapists, and even occupational therapists, serves an important role in the development and upkeep of its players. Athletic training involves the management, assessment, and intervention of emergent, intermittent, and long-term medical disorders, including disability, occupational restrictions, and impairments. Fitness development, which is more prevalent in corporate gymnasium settings, is sometimes mistaken for strength and conditioning training. While athletic trainers possess many of the same talents as fitness experts, their roles and obligations are very diverse.
For instance, as athletes develop bigger, subtler, and quicker bodies; athletic trainers have a greater obligation to adjust to their unique demands. These requirements may encompass, but are not confined to, pain evaluation and diagnosis, recuperation, massage treatment, nutritional support, and accident prevention. According to Ford (2003), when a therapist and a patient are from different cultures, power equilibration becomes more difficult. Furthermore, the hegemonic contemporary cultural background and mindset have had a long-term influence on racial power dynamics, impacting everyday issues linked with prejudice and bigotry. When likened to prior years, the industry is generating more unsatisfied experts, and even more are wishing to quit totally because of racism and ethic disparity. In athletics, athletic trainers’ anxiety levels might rise due to a variety of factors, including the athlete’s desire to return to the field as soon as possible after facing such discriminating actions, or the manager might decide to play someone despite the trainer’s advice.
Because sporting organizations make so many choices, it may be challenging to assign responsibility when problems arise. In this case, the sports trainer is in a strange role since they are responsible for a wide range of concerns inside a single institution. When examining an athletic illness, for example, particularly one involving a star athlete, the trainer’s recommendations might have far-reaching consequences that influence not just the trainer and the player, but perhaps the whole program.
Apart from physical and health-related issues, inclusivity and diversity in sports training is a contemporary and expanding issue in the field of kinesiology. Because of ethnic gaps, racism, and job complexity, there is increased stress within the profession, making it increasingly difficult to perform at the training center. Every aspect of a curriculum might have an influence on how one makes a choice. For example, there is a considerable demand from sportsmen who want to participate and may be required to contest in order to get an education.
The manager’s desire, the urge for an athlete to fight for wins, and lastly, the firm’s pressure to fill seats may generate money and pay checks, though at the cost of the trainer. The sports trainer may be faced with scenarios in which not just one, but all of these demands need attention and inclusion. Because the intrinsic unique connection between the two entities makes incompetent legislation so appealing for players to utilize against trainers, it is all too simple to over include coaching staff and instructors. With the present chain of leadership and bureaucratic structure on college and professional sporting teams, it is unrealistic to hold the trainer liable for negligence allegations if the participant was fully informed of their situation and the hazards of participation.
If injury prevention educators and instructors are not cautious of the significantly bigger cultural and academic roles associated with education, they may become accomplices in the research and manufacture of immensely experienced and talented technocratic experts who may not possess the critical threshold of abilities that epitomizes the institution’s romantic ideals and its broader academic intent. If this is permitted to continue, many future sports trainers may find themselves unable to contribute to the bigger, more vital tasks necessary for real democratic participation. To be clear, the assertion made here does not assume that sports training should not be subjected to and held responsible for quantifiable outcomes that “characterize” the admittance level of athletic training consultants (Adams et al., 2021). Moreover, athletic training does not advocate for the marginalization of contemporary academic benchmarks based on insights that influence the athletic profession and training. Rather, all the institutions’ instructors have a goal that is simultaneous and as significant as the corresponding main program of athletic training.
Maintaining awareness of and reverence for higher principles of personal learning and development is critical for all learners. Sports training instructors, as members of the institution, must also consider intellectual awareness as a necessary prerequisite for legally performing the leading professional tasks connected with academia. However, although instructors have little power over the overall culture of sports, their individualized efforts in the sports training room may have a tremendous impact (Maurer-Starks et al., 2008). One strategy for sports training instructors to improve the minimum threshold of their curriculum and pedagogy is to aggressively incorporate inclusive practices and promote diversity into all elements of their training materials.
Professional athletic trainers cannot be solely athletic trainers since athletic coaching is now legally recognized as an affiliated healthcare profession and its practitioners operate in diverse settings with a broad range of patients, trainees, and coworkers. Athletic trainers, on the other hand, must constantly aspire to become lifelong learners competent at connecting with and comprehending a wide range of perspectives, ideas, skills, and viewpoints. Irrespective of the specific corporate setting or work requirements, most sports therapists are challenged on a constant basis with problems of racism, class, sexual orientation, and ethnic diversity (Day et al., 2021; Maurer-Starks et al., 2008). Because different sociocultural influences occur in both personal and intellectual athletic training environments, trainees must be adequately instructed to accept and handle crucial challenges.
Now it is clear that all sports exercise physiology experts will require a substantial multicultural perspective that surpasses competent knowledge and expertise. One that allows for a vital and compassionate perspective on “others’” opinions, and one that empowers the sports training and athletics expert to optimize the landscape and access to care and outreach programs. As a result, sports training curriculums must officially, phenomenologically, and cognitively equip their learners for their upcoming relational, civic, and corporate duties. The previous National Athletic Trainers’ Association (NATA) report emphasizes the importance of incorporating cultural competency and diversity training into education programs. For these and other reasons, current and future sports training experts, instructors, and learners must become more multiculturally knowledgeable, culturally competent, and socially experienced.
Athletic trainers currently operate in a wide range of professional contexts, as seen by the demographic data. In the next few years, instructors and future sports trainers will face an exciting and demanding dynamic in the diversified professional context. Historically, the difficulties involved with racial desegregation among athletic trainers were likely similar to those experienced in wider society. There are concerns about how sports trainers function in various environments. For example, how athletic training students are equipped to deal with problems of racial, socioeconomic, gender, cultural, and ideological variety may impact, if not determine, athletic trainers’ relative social and professional performance in these varied environments.
Aside from technical proficiency, if sports trainers in varied contexts manage the complicated concerns of diversity relationships properly, their professional efficiency and societal approval may flourish. Conversely, if sports trainers struggle with the greater social, political, and interpersonal aspects of their work, their career possibilities may decline with time. As a result, as part of the pedagogical and curricular change underway in exercise science, an increasing number of schools are pursuing plans or designs in order to continue their sports training students. Therefore, more in-depth activities that enable students to identify and explain their own ethnocultural origins will help learners feel connected to the course’s wider learning goals, as well as more open-ended programs to encourage learners to talk about their own experiences. More study is needed to determine how athletic trainers can play a role in inclusion and diversity in sports, therefore bridging the gap produced by individuals who quit due to feelings of marginalization and institutional racism.

Due to a lack of diversity in the profession’s workforce and academia, there is a dearth of culturally competent sports training therapists and instructors. The foundation for a culturally sensitive setting will be laid by qualified sports trainers and therapists’ readiness to raise awareness and combat prejudices and misconceptions. According to Ford (2003), professional sports trainers and clinicians should be aware that culture influences a person’s decisions, actions, and reactions. As a result, the study was directed by the following question: what criteria should be incorporated into an academic curriculum to prepare a proficient sports training specialist in an ethnically varied society? Despite the ambiguity, data were gathered through critical examination of other papers, and the findings were organized into themes and subthemes. Ford (2003) conducted research that defined cultural competency in mental health services in order to satisfy the conflicting demands of highly skilled athletic trainers in NATA."
"The cultural effects of Roman dominance over the Greek-speaking regions were far-reaching and complex, with the interaction between the two cultures varying in time and space. One significant aspect of this dominance was the transmission of Roman names into public life, which had a profound impact on the cultural landscape of the regions. This essay will explore the factors contributing to the dissemination of Roman names and the adoption of a common onomastic culture, with a focus on the role of civic elites in mediating these cultural transfers.
The interaction between Roman and Greek cultures was characterized by a blend of assimilation and resistance. Initially, the Romans conquered the Greek-speaking regions, imposing their language and customs. However, over time, a form of cultural synthesis took place, with the Romans adopting and appreciating aspects of Greek culture. This synthesis was reflected in the transmission of Roman names into public life. Names, as expressions of identity, power, and prestige, held significant meaning for both Romans and Greeks, and the adoption of Roman names by the Greek-speaking population signified a desire to align oneself with the dominant culture.
Several factors contributed to the dissemination of Roman names. First, the political power of Rome meant that Roman names became symbols of authority and legitimacy. Greek rulers and elites adopted Roman names to enhance their status and secure their positions within the imperial framework. This was particularly evident in the eastern provinces, where Roman names became increasingly prevalent among the local aristocracy. These elites served as mediators between the dominant Roman culture and the local populations, facilitating the adoption of Roman names and the subsequent spread of Roman onomastic culture.
Furthermore, the Roman practice of granting citizenship to individuals from the conquered territories enhanced the dissemination of Roman names. In order to take advantage of the privileges and opportunities afforded by Roman citizenship, many Greeks sought to Romanize their names. This was seen as a means of upward social mobility and integration into the imperial system. As a result, a common onomastic culture emerged, with individuals across the Greek-speaking regions adopting Roman naming conventions.
The shift in naming traditions during late antiquity was influenced by Christianity's progress and the decline of the Roman Empire. As Christianity spread and gained influence, the use of distinctly Roman names declined. Many individuals embraced Christian names as a reflection of their newfound faith and identity. Additionally, with the decline of the Roman Empire, the prestige associated with Roman names diminished. Local naming traditions began to resurface, and the adoption of Roman names no longer held the same significance as before.
In conclusion, Roman dominance over the Greek-speaking regions had profound cultural effects, including the transmission of Roman names into public life. The interaction between the two cultures varied over time and space, with a blend of assimilation and resistance. Factors such as political power, the granting of citizenship, and the role of civic elites contributed to the dissemination of Roman names and the adoption of a common onomastic culture. However, with the progress of Christianity and the decline of the Roman Empire, naming traditions shifted, reflecting changing identities and the reemergence of local naming conventions."
"Introduction:
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a myriad of challenges for healthcare professionals, with unprecedented levels of stress, workload, and exposure to trauma. The mental health impacts of this crisis on healthcare professionals cannot be underestimated. Healthcare managers play a crucial role in proactively addressing and supporting the mental well-being of these professionals. This essay will explore several key strategies that healthcare managers can implement to effectively address the mental health needs of healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic.

By supporting those who care for others, we not only promote job satisfaction and productivity but also strengthen the foundation of our healthcare system during these challenging times."
"Macroeconomic variables are indicators of production and consumption volumes, income and expenses, activity, and efficiency of the global economical level. These are also indicators of the rank of the well-being of the population, exports and imports operations, the overall rate of economic growth, and other economic processes. Macroeconomic variables tend to reflect general trends in the economy, the following circumstances, and their current level.
The main indicator of the system of the macroeconomy is the gross domestic product (GDP). It characterizes the value of final goods and services produced by residents of the country for a certain period, minus the costs of intermediate consumption. GDP is measured at market costs for final consumption at prices paid by the buyer, including all trade and transport margins and taxes on products. During an economic crisis or a lack of internal resources, this indicator can rapidly fluctuate and decline. If GDP increases, it means that more goods and services are produced in the country, the income and tax deductions of which can be included in the country’s income (Dvorský et al., 2020). If the GDP declines, this indicates the beginning of an economic crisis that negatively affects both: the target and business.
Inflation is another economic indicator to track the level of a country. The process can begin for various reasons, including a shortage of goods on the market, monopoly of large firms, currency instability, and so on. Inflation has a huge impact on the economy and all types of financial instruments. Inflation is a steady rise in the general price level. However, this is the severe process of devaluation of paper money due to a violation of the laws of monetary circulation. Buyers have a limited ability to pay for purchases, and the business will suffer large losses from this. In addition, inflation also affects the purchase of raw materials, goods for sale, payment of employee salaries, and so on (Dvorský et al., 2020). The higher the inflation rate, the more unstable the market situation for businesses and customers.
Macroeconomic indicators are the central indicators of the economy, with the help of which it is possible to determine the state of the economy as a whole. Critical changes of any of the indicators can portend a sharp change in a situation on markets and with currencies. Therefore, leading economists, brokers, and traders are constantly monitoring the latest macroeconomic data to update the state and the relevant strategy."
"The business world is ever-changing, and companies must always be flexible to these changes. One of the changes that a business might need to adapt to is an expanding target market. P&G currently sells personal care products to a market that is comprised primarily of women. However, research shows that there is a growing market among male consumers due to the rise of male grooming. P&G should restructure to take advantage of the new market for men’s care products.
P&G will need to make several changes to capitalize on the “ignored” market. The restructuring will affect various departments such as research and development, product design, and sales and marketing. Their redesign will affect their employee recruitment and selection practices (Szymczyk, 2016). For instance, currently, most employees that deal with skin and hair care products, cosmetics, and fragrances are female. This is because the target market is mostly women, which means that the products are probably developed, designed, and marketed by women. To attract a new target audience of men, the company will need to hire more male employees (Nadube & Didia, 2018). Male consumers will be more satisfied with male-only personal care products. These products are best developed by people who are male themselves and understand what other men would want. The research and development, product design, and sales and marketing departments must comprise more male employees.
The main contextual variable that led to P&G’s restructuring was the changes in the target market as revealed by a study. The study was conducted by Male Grooming Trends: Profiting in 2009 and Beyond. It showed that although female consumers dominated the market for personal grooming products, the market for male consumers was quickly expanding. P&G saw an opportunity to profit from an expanding market. Therefore, redesigning was necessitated by changes in the market characteristics.
Several companies have restructured to capitalize on a larger target market. Examples include Harley Davidson Motorcycles, NFL, and Stryx. Traditionally, the demographic market for motorcycles was older white men. However, following a decrease in motorcycle sales, Harley Davidson started targeting female customers (Moreno, 2017). They customized their bikes to women’s needs and found creative ways to market these bikes to women. Second, the National Football League discovered in a study that women comprised over 40% of their viewership (Townes, 2019). They then expanded their target market beyond the usual male customers and started to make merchandise for women. Finally, Stryx is a company that has capitalized on the growing market for male makeup products. The companies mentioned have been widely successful in expanding their markets. Other companies should also capitalize on their expanding target market. For instance, traditionally male-dominated gyms should consider opening women-only gyms. Although women are now exercising just as much as men, there are not enough gyms for them. Overall, companies should be quick to adapt to changes in the market.
In conclusion, companies should keep up-to-date with any changes in the market. All industries are constantly evolving, and it would be unwise for businesses to stick to old ways. In the given case study, P&G has the potential to generate profit from a new market for personal care products. It will need to redesign its recruitment practices to exploit this opportunity. Restructuring for a new reality can be a profitable venture if done correctly as shown by Harley Davidson, NFL, and Stryx."
"Throughout the COVID-19 global public health crisis, supply chain and transportation issues have posed a continual challenge. During the outbreak, shipping issues caused havoc on the medical equipment and healthcare institutions as a request for key items and other medical aid increased. Concerning the opportunity for improvement, it can be proposed to separate working groups into multiple teams and subgroups responsible for operating in different areas and regions.
Medical equipment is utilized for the diagnosis and therapy and treatment of patients after a disease or accident; it can be used alone or in conjunction with various consumables. Healthcare equipment and supplies are essential for patients’ needs, and the inability to obtain the necessary medicament can seriously threaten life. Consequently, in terms of maintaining a high level of treatment quality, it is obligatory to establish an efficient and effective medical equipment delivery and shipping system, elaborating a supply chain. At the commencement of the global pandemic, pharmaceutical products and equipment were desperately required in developing countries, and numerous offerings were acquired that needed to be packed for transportation. With regard to my contribution, it can be stated that I suggested the concept of splitting into smaller teams and subgroups, each focusing on a separate area. This enabled the group to segregate two full deliveries of donated medical supplies in two to three days instead of two to three. Thus, it was possible to send the healthcare equipment and medicaments successfully.
In conclusion, patients’ needs for healthcare equipment and supplies are critical, and the failure to receive the appropriate medication might be life-threatening. In terms of my contribution, I proposed separating into smaller teams and subgroups, each concentrating on a different aspect of the project. This allowed the group to segregate and classify two complete deliveries of donated medical goods in two to three days rather than two to three."
"Introduction (approximately 100 words):
Recruitment is a critical aspect of any organization, ensuring the selection of qualified individuals who align with its objectives. Nevertheless, this process presents numerous challenges that can hinder the effectiveness of recruitment efforts. This essay aims to delve into the key challenges faced in the recruitment process and provide strategies to address them. By examining the areas of attracting candidates, evaluating fit, and reducing biases, organizations can enhance their recruitment practices and attract the most suitable talent.
Challenges in Attracting Candidates (approximately 200 words):
One of the primary challenges in the recruitment process lies in attracting a diverse pool of qualified candidates. Traditional job advertisements often fail to reach desired demographics, as they are limited to specific platforms or rely on word-of-mouth referrals. To address this, organizations should diversify their recruitment channels by utilizing online job boards and professional networking platforms. Furthermore, adopting targeted marketing techniques will enable organizations to reach a wider range of potential candidates.
Additionally, organizations must revamp their employer branding strategies to attract top talent. By showcasing the company's values, culture, and career development opportunities, organizations can differentiate themselves from competitors. Establishing an engaging online presence through a well-maintained career website and active social media presence can significantly enhance the appeal of the organization to potential candidates.
Evaluating Fit and Competency (approximately 200 words):
Evaluating the fit and competency of candidates is crucial during the recruitment process. However, this often poses as a challenge, particularly due to the complexity of assessing intangible qualities such as cultural fit, motivation, and interpersonal skills. To overcome this hurdle, implementing a multi-faceted evaluation process incorporating several methods can yield more comprehensive insights into a candidate’s abilities and compatibility.
Firstly, including behavioral-based interview questions allows recruiters to gauge a candidate's problem-solving skills, adaptability, and leadership capabilities. Additionally, interactive assessments, such as role-playing or hypothetical scenarios, provide valuable insights into a candidate's decision-making process and work approach.
Moreover, utilizing realistic job previews through shadowing programs or trial periods can provide candidates with a firsthand experience of the role and organizational culture, leading to better decision-making for both parties.
Addressing Bias and Promoting Diversity (approximately 200 words):
Overcoming unconscious bias in the recruitment process is a significant challenge for organizations. Unintentional biases can influence decision-making, leading to unfair practices and excluding potentially valuable candidates. Adopting strategies to minimize bias can create a more inclusive recruitment process.
One effective strategy is to implement anonymous applications, where personal identifiers such as names, gender, and age are excluded. Additionally, training recruiters and hiring managers on unconscious biases can promote awareness and lead to fairer assessments. Employing diverse interview panels can also foster a more inclusive environment and minimize bias by gathering different perspectives during candidate evaluations.
Furthermore, organizations should actively prioritize diversity and inclusion throughout the recruitment process. Collaborating with different communities, attending job fairs centered around underrepresented groups, and leveraging diverse employee networks are all effective methods to proactively attract a diverse range of candidates.
Conclusion (approximately 100 words):
Recruitment is a complex process with numerous challenges. However, organizations can overcome these obstacles through strategic efforts to attract candidates, evaluate fit, and address biases. By diversifying recruitment channels, implementing comprehensive evaluation techniques, and actively promoting diversity, companies can create a more inclusive recruitment process. This, in turn, will ensure the selection of qualified individuals who contribute immensely to the growth and success of the organization."
"Purpose: The purpose of this evidence brief is to prove that the utilization of registered nurses as primary team members interacting with patients during telehealth visits in an outpatient setting will improve patient outcomes.
 1. PIO In the outpatient clinical setting, will the utilization of registered nurses as a primary team member to perform telehealth visits improve patient outcomes?
 2. Background: Due to the increasing demand to access care, there is increased demand for telehealth during the pandemic. The issue is to meet the demand. Registered Nurses need to become Primary Team Members to interact with Patients during Telehealth.
 3. Objective: The objective of this research is to discover information on how registered nurses can play a role as primary team members during telehealth visits through Evidence-Based Practice to improve patient outcomes.

         1. Nurses’ capabilities and communication skills, including their ability to listen and be sensitive to their patients, nurses’ control of the interaction to keep it relevant improved telephone interactions with the patients. However, background noises when a caller calls, communication problems such as inadequate communication, callers’ inappropriate behavior, inability to conduct an assessment, callers’ inability to describe the symptoms, issues such as family members providing different information than information provided by callers, technical issues, lack of appointments to accommodate all the callers, and long queues all these make it difficult to have effective interactions (Yliluoma & Palonen 2020).

         1. Many people are interested in utilizing Telehealth but there are several barriers on both patients’ and clinicians’ sides. Patients lack digital skills and literacy, have no access to the internet, or limited data plan which makes it difficult to have a quality telehealth visit. Similarly, many healthcare settings are unable to provide video-enabled devices to their clinicians, use difficult apps, or have security issues (Robeznieks, 2021). (Expert Reviewed)

         1. This study explored the experiences of telehealth for vulnerable patients in general practice during the pandemic. The significant findings of this study concluded that patients are satisfied with telehealth for its convenience and efficiency. However, patients expressed that this only works if the patient and provider have already developed a relationship prior to the transformation of care. Another finding is that the common use of telehealth is for medication refills, follow-ups and reviewing diagnostic results. (Javaboarast, Kwok, Reed & Roeger, 2021) Level VI

This study is to explore the results of medication adherence rate and disease process on patients with rheumatoid arthritis via customized telehealth education versus patients discharged home with standard care instructions. The telehealth education includes disease process, treatment goals, how to take medication properly and side effects. The results of this study concluded that customized telehealth education after discharge leads to a better medication adherence rate and, therefore, better symptom control and prohibits the progression of the disease.

         1. Although telehealth is typically associated with remote care in therapy and related procedures, the paper by Asiri et al. (2018) establishes that telehealth can also be used in a surgical context. Specifically, the authors of the study prove the importance of incorporating telehealth as the device for patient evaluation after the surgery, thus, assessing the efficacy of the surgery and the extent of its success. Moreover, the threat of nosocomial infections and the associated concerns can be avoided with the help of the proposed technique. The study proves the role of telehealth in modern nursing.

         1. The study assesses the extent of telehealth efficacy in the environment of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the results of the study, the range of telehealth applications by APNs has expanded to embrace a variety of patient-specific needs, which has led to a rise in patient satisfaction rates. Compared to in-person visits, the use of telehealth has proven to be much more popular with patients as the tool that allows APNs to establish a rapport with the target population quickly. Moreover, the accuracy of the diagnosis and the opportunity to minimize medical errors when performing the assessment of a patient and to administer the required treatment have been noted as important factors in improving the performance of APNs.

         1. In the section “Examples of Redesigned Roles for Nurses”, the Department of Veterans Affairs recreated and extended nurses’ roles in the health care system to collaborate with Advanced Practice Registered Nurses, and the result exceeded its expectation. RNs are assigned to coordinate care and chronic disease management, while APRNs are the primary care providers. The result of this collaboration showed VA patients are getting better care, as evidenced by many quality-of-care indicators in comparison to Medicare patients. (Institute of Medicine, 2011)

         1. Representing an important voice in the community of experts on the subject matter, Jnr (2020) explains in his paper that the role of nurses in promoting the use of telehealth in the healthcare context is vital in fighting the coronavirus pandemic. The study outlines the challenges associated with providing virtual care and offers solutions based on the promotion of nurse-patient communication. In turn, Telehealth is seen as a central tool in assisting nurses in building connections with patients. According to the results of the study, telehealth and other tools for remote healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic has a largely positive effect.

         1. The paper by Lowe et al. (2012) details the significance of support and professional performance by advanced practice nurses in the healthcare setting. Specifically, the research illustrates the role of APNs in the healthcare context has been debated quite profusely and shaped significantly over the past decade. However, the authors agree that the role of an APN in the nursing setting should expand to include of patient education and raising awareness. However, the authors also warn that, with the blurring of the lines between nurses’ roles, certain ambiguity about the functions of an APN emerges. Therefore, the study encourages examining the expansion in the range of APNs’ responsibilities and functions, implying that alleviation of the workload may be needed.

         1. The study shows that APNs have a critical function in the context of modern healthcare. Specifically, APNs contribute substantially to the extent of a patient’s access to critical care by improving the efficacy of communication and precision in service delivery. Furthermore, the study proves that the inclusion of APNs into the critical care context leads to reduced length of hospital stay, as well as an increased rate of patient satisfaction. Promoting innovation in the hospital setting and encouraging autonomy in nurses, APNs contribute to a significant rise in the efficacy of critical care. Thus, the research establishes an important shift in the perception of APNs and their function in the nursing context, transforming their role in critical care toward a more meaningful one."
"Introduction (approximately 50 words)
Diabetes, a chronic metabolic disorder affecting millions worldwide, encompasses two primary types - Type 1 and Type 2. This essay delves into the core mechanisms, symptoms, and recommended dietary and medication regimens for managing each type, aiming to provide comprehensive insights into the management strategies for these conditions.
Body:
I. Core Mechanisms and Symptoms (approximately 150 words)
Type 1 Diabetes:
Type 1 diabetes results from an autoimmune response, where the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. This process ultimately leads to an absolute insulin deficiency.
Significant symptoms include extreme thirst, frequent urination, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and blurry vision.
Type 2 Diabetes:
Type 2 diabetes is primarily characterized by insulin resistance, where cells fail to respond effectively to insulin or the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin. Over time, insulin production may decrease, worsening the condition.
Common symptoms involve increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, recurrent infections, slow-healing wounds, and blurred vision.
II. Dietary Regimens (approximately 100 words)
Type 1 Diabetes:
Ensuring proper insulin management is crucial for individuals with Type 1 diabetes. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels should be paired with appropriate insulin injections or Insulin Pump Therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion). A balanced diet consisting of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, with particular attention to carbohydrate counting, is vital for maintaining stable blood sugar levels.
Type 2 Diabetes:
Managing Type 2 diabetes often involves lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes. A well-balanced diet rich in whole grains, lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats is recommended. Additionally, portion control, carbohydrate counting, reducing sugar and saturated fat intake, and incorporating regular physical activity play pivotal roles in minimizing blood sugar fluctuations and optimizing overall health.
III. Medication Regimens (approximately 100 words)
Type 1 Diabetes:
Due to the complete inability to produce insulin, individuals with Type 1 diabetes require daily insulin injections. Multiple daily injections or insulin pump therapy are often prescribed to maintain blood glucose levels within a target range. Regular blood sugar monitoring is crucial to adjust insulin dosages accordingly, especially in response to diet, exercise, and stress.
Type 2 Diabetes:
For most individuals with Type 2 diabetes, lifestyle changes are the primary focus initially. However, if blood glucose levels remain elevated, oral medications, such as metformin, may be prescribed. In some cases, insulin injections may be necessary to manage blood sugar levels effectively.
Conclusion (approximately 50 words)
In summary, understanding the core mechanisms and symptoms of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes is essential in managing these conditions effectively. Adopting appropriate dietary regimens, combined with regular monitoring and adherence to prescribed medication regimens, empowers individuals with diabetes to live healthier lives with better glycemic control. Consulting with healthcare professionals is crucial to develop personalized strategies tailored to each individual's needs."
"Autumn is not generally viewed as an appropriate season for having a garage sale, not to mention that one on a scale of a local community. However, what makes my neighbourhood particularly unique and different from others is its consistent inability to meet expectations (Pyrkosz 147). Either due to some event that occurred too long ago for any of the neighbours to remember or care, or out of sheer need to have something extravagant in the midst of one of the least unpredictable seasons ever, my community has a massive garage sale every autumn. Although the weather and the lingering threat of health issues complicated the task, the community garage sale carried out last fall was one of the highlights of its members’ public life due to the opportunity to communicate and share memories, objects, and ideas.
The range and diversity of the items that our numerous neighbours and community members offered as sales items could easily make one feel surprised. Though being admittedly cheap and often worn-out, these items told exciting stories about the lives of their owners (Hassan 68). For instance, some of the kitchenware sold during the event was quite old, with the style thereof allowing tracking down its origin to quite far back in the past. Though these items were certainly not of high price, they still led to rather fascinating revelations about the cultural legacy of their owners and their fascinating life stories.
As it often happens during large garage sales, there was some drama. For instance, one of the neighborhood children recognized one of their treasured possessions among the sold items, causing quite a stir. Luckily, the buyer was understanding enough and returned the purchase, which turned out to be a collection of action figures, without any questions. It was truly heartwarming to observe the understanding and cooperation that buyers showed during that garage sale.
Furthermore, it was worth noting that a substantial portion of the money collected during the garage sale was donated to assist those in need. Specifically, those suffering from the coronavirus, as well as members of impoverished communities and several local charities, were provided with a portion of the finances form the yard sale. Though the event resulted in a rather humble outcome, the money donated to the specified parties were definitely used to improve the lives of those suffering inequality and health disparities (Arasteh 867). Therefore, the yard sale was not only an important social event and a chance for the participants to earn some money, but also an opportunity to improve the lives of those in need.
Apart from the economic benefit that the community garage sale introduced, the chance to share memories, ideas, and emotions was a particularly important part of the event. Though the concept of a yard sale might seem far too common and, therefore, lacking excitement, it, in fact, represents a unique opportunity to communicate and share experiences for the participants involved. Given the diversity of my community, the process was especially enlightening and leading to multiple new insights. Though the season might be seen as unsuitable for a yard sale, especially on a community scale, it di provide a perfect opportunity to embrace the opportunities that it provided and encourage participants to share their ideas. Thus, the weird yet lovely tradition of our community, the fall yard sale has left quite an impact on me."
"There are several ways to compare and contrast the Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations. Socially, the two civilizations were very different; the Greeks were known for their strong sense of democracy, while the Mesopotamians were ruled by kings and queens. Politically, there were also major differences; the Greeks were republics, while the Mesopotamians had empires. Economically, Ancient Greece was known for its many exports, while Mesopotamia was mostly an agricultural society. Culturally, the two civilizations differed in terms of their writing systems and religions. The Greeks used an alphabet that is still in use today, while the Mesopotamians developed a cuneiform script. Therefore, there are eminently social, political, economic, and cultural differences and similarities between Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek.
The social differences between the Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations were vast. Mesopotamia was a very hierarchical society, with a strict caste system in place. There was very little opportunity for social mobility, and the powerful ruled over the masses with an iron fist. Ancient Greece, on the other hand, was much more egalitarian. People were able to move up in status if they were talented or ambitious, and democracy was practiced in many city-states (Adams 35). This resulted in a much more prosperous society overall. Similarly, Ancient Greece was a much more democratic society than Mesopotamia. In Athens, for example, all male citizens had the right to vote and participate in government. Wealthy citizens could not buy their way into office; they had to be elected by their peers. Mesopotamian society was much more stratified; at the top were the rulers and priests, followed by a small number of wealthy landowners (Adams 43). The vast majority of people were slaves or peasants who worked the land. There was no concept of democracy in Mesopotamia; instead, society was ruled by a small elite group who claimed divine authority.
Both Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations exhibited a great deal of social similarity. For example, both were patriarchal societies in which women had few rights and were largely confined to the home. In addition, both societies placed a high value on warfare and physical prowess and considered martial prowess to be one of the key markers of manhood. There were also some key differences between these two civilizations. One major difference was that the Ancient Greeks were far more egalitarian than the Mesopotamians (Frahm 119). This is evidenced by the fact that in Ancient Greece, women could own property, engage in business, and even participate in politics. Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations were strikingly similar in terms of their social structures. Both were based on hierarchies in which people were divided into classes according to their wealth, power, and status. However, the two civilizations differed in terms of their religious beliefs. The Mesopotamians believed in a pantheon of gods, while the Ancient Greeks believed in a single god who governed the world.
The two civilizations differed in their political structures; Mesopotamia was a theocracy, while Greece was a democracy. Mesopotamia’s theocracy meant that the gods were responsible for guiding the human king in carrying out his responsibilities. In contrast, Greek democracy placed ultimate power in the hands of all free male citizens (Frahm 117). This resulted in decisions being made through discourse and voting, as opposed to divine guidance. The two civilizations differed in their political structures. Mesopotamia was a theocracy, while Ancient Greece was a republic. In Mesopotamia, the king was considered to be the representative of the gods on Earth. He had absolute power and controlled all aspects of society (Frahm 111). In Ancient Greece, by contrast, citizens had the right to vote and to participate in government. There were also many different city-states, each with its laws and customs. This allowed for a great deal of diversity and debate.
Similarly, both cultures were polytheistic, with a pantheon of gods and goddesses who controlled all aspects of human life. They also shared similar architectural styles, with temples and palaces constructed similarly. The most significant similarity between these two cultures is their approach to warfare (Adams 55). Both Mesopotamians and Ancient Greeks believed that a victorious battle could bring great rewards, not only for the victors but for the entire city or nation. This led to highly strategic wars fought by armies of brave soldiers who valued their honor above all else.
Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations were outstandingly similar in their political structures. Both were considered city-states, and each city was ruled by a king who had complete authority within his domain (Frahm 121). Citizens of the city were required to obey the king’s decrees, and disputes between cities were often resolved through warfare. The major difference between these two civilizations was in their religious beliefs. The Mesopotamians believed in many gods, while the Ancient Greeks only believed in one god, Zeus. This difference led to different attitudes towards warfare – the Mesopotamians fought for religious reasons, while the Ancient Greeks fought for political reasons (to expand or protect their territory). The two civilizations had some political similarities in that they were both led by powerful kings, and their economies were based largely on agriculture (Frahm 115). However, the Mesopotamian civilization was considerably more advanced than the Ancient Greek civilization. For example, the Mesopotamians developed writing, while the Ancient Greeks did not. Additionally, the Mesopotamians had a more complex system of government, with a large number of social classes and a complex legal system.
The main economic difference between the Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations was that the Mesopotamians were a more mercantile society while the Ancient Greeks were more focused on agriculture. The Mesopotamians were merchants who traded goods such as textiles, spices, and metals. They built their economy on the principle of credit and debt, which led to a high level of commercial activity. The Ancient Greeks, on the other hand, were farmers who grew their food (Heriyanto 95). They did not have as strong a trading economy and instead focused on developing their political and artistic cultures. The ancient Mesopotamian and Greek civilizations were two of the most influential in history.
Though they share some similarities, there are several key differences between them. Mesopotamia was an early example of a centrally planned economy. Central planners decided what goods would be produced, how much of each good would be produced, and what prices would be charged. This caused shortages and surpluses of goods, as well as widespread corruption. In Ancient Greece, by contrast, many different city-states had their independent economies (Heriyanto 75). There was no central authority dictating what should be produced or how much should be produced; rather, merchants and traders decided what to sell based on the products available.
The two civilizations had different cultural beliefs that led to different economic systems. In Mesopotamia, there was a strong belief in gods and goddesses, which led to the creation of temples and religious ceremonies. This led to a strong sense of community and cooperation, which helped create a thriving economy (Adams 33). In ancient Greece, on the other hand, there was a belief in human rationality and individualism. This led to the development of philosophy and democracy, which helped create a prosperous society.
Another difference between these two civilizations is their respective attitudes toward warfare. The Mesopotamians were a warrior culture, and war was an integral part of their society (Frahm 109). Homer’s Iliad, which recounts the Trojan War, is an example of this type of literature. The Ancient Greeks, on the other hand, were not a warrior culture. The ideal citizen in a Greek city-state participated in politics and cultivated his mind and body. The Mesopotamian sculpture is characterized by its realism and its emphasis on the power and strength of the human figure. Another key difference between these two cultures is that the Greeks placed a strong emphasis on individualism and self-expression, while Mesopotamian culture was more focused on maintaining social order and tradition.
There are several cultural similarities between the Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations. For example, both cultures were highly patriarchal, with men holding power in both the private and public spheres (Frahm 107). Both cultures were also quite advanced in terms of their technological developments; for example, the Greeks were some of the first people to develop a system of writing. On the other hand, the Mesopotamians were responsible for developing some of the earliest forms of mathematics and astronomy.
In conclusion, Mesopotamian and Greek civilizations may be compared and contrasted in a variety of ways. Greeks were famed for their strong sense of democracy, whereas Mesopotamians were controlled by kings and queens. Conversely, Mesopotamia was ruled by a theocracy, whereas a democratic system ruled Greece. Ancient Greece was well-known for its various exports, but Mesopotamia was mostly an agricultural culture. Aside from language and religion, the two civilizations were culturally distinct. Cuneiform writing was established by the Mesopotamians, whereas the Greek alphabet is still in use today. Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek civilizations were strikingly similar in that each city-state was headed by a monarch who exercised absolute power over his territory. A commonality across societies is that males had authority in both the private and public arenas. Mesopotamian and Ancient Greek society, politics, economy, and culture are different and similar to one another."
"Introduction
Groups are common in almost every aspect of human life. They can be formal or informal and are found at home, school, or the workplace. Groups feature people with shared responsibility and objectives. Collaboration is vital as the workload is spread among the members. Communication, sacrifice, and tolerance must be in plenty, given that different personalities are involved. Group leadership is an essential skill that determines the group’s success by creating a relaxed atmosphere, keeping the group focused on the goal, and mitigating conflicts.
Type of Group: Workplace
I work in the sales department as a supervisor managing 20 members. Our role is centered on pushing sales and making more profits for the company. As a group leader, I have the responsibility of ensuring that our objectives are aligned with the overall company objectives. Unfortunately, my group is laden with some behavioral challenges such as time management and resistance to direction, which affect performance negatively.
Encountered Problems
Missed Targets
Some team members have been missing the weekly sales targets, and most of the culprits show no signs of improvement. At first, the issue was with three of them, but the problem has escalated and now affects almost half of the team. Because of this, the overall team performance has been compromised. As the leader, I need to address this to inspire everyone back to their winning moods.
Poor Time Management
Part of the reason why the team is underperforming is poor time management. The work policy stipulates that all staff should report to work at 9:00 A.M and leave at 5:00 P.M. However, some of the staff in my group do not always observe time. Reporting late takes away some hours that could otherwise have been used to generate more sales and thus boost performance.
Resistance to Direction
As the group leader, I am responsible for developing strategies that I expect everyone to follow. While some members always cooperate in supporting me in the role, some have fashioned themselves as a resistance faction. The group often rejects most of my ideas during meetings and tries to pull the rest toward their position. This has hampered progress as we spend too much time on unproductive arguments and counterarguments.
Low Motivation
My team’s motivation has been on a downward trajectory for the last two months, which is a worrying trend. The low motivation forms the foundation for all the other challenges currently affecting members’ performance. This is a grave concern, given that performance is dependent on motivation as a significant factor. A preliminary investigation shows that my members are not satisfied with the current working conditions.
The solution to the Problems
The identified problems are all behavioral and could be solved through some approaches proposed by behaviorism psychologists such as Ivan Pavlov and B.F Skinner. Human behavior is subject to change based on modifying factors such as motivation. Positive behavior should be reinforced to flourish, while negative behavior should be discouraged to diminish. As a group leader, I would approach the problems from a behavioral angle employing such techniques as classical conditioning, positive reinforcement, behavior shaping, behavior modeling, reinforcement schedules, and punishment where applicable.
Classical Conditioning
Developed by Ian Pavlov, classical conditioning suggests that learning happens through a conditioned action triggered by a combination of unconditioned and neutral stimuli (Rehman et al., 2022). I would introduce weekly rewards attached to sales performance. The move is likely to make the members associate the rewards with their roles every time they meet the set target; they get rewarded. This will be effective in solving the problem of missed targets.
Positive Reinforcement
Positive reinforcement involves taking actions such as using rewards to promote good behavior and inspire a long-term positive character (Itri et al., 2019). The approach will apply to solving the problem of time management affecting my group’s current affecting members. I will recognize and commend members who report to their duties on time to inspire a repeated action that would ultimately become a sustained behavior.
Behavior Shaping
Behavior shaping is a deliberate process aimed at modifying one’s character. Shaping my group members’ behavior could help check their resistance to my ideas. The process starts with changing their perspectives on how they perceive me as their leader. I should incorporate their suggestions rather than make unilateral decisions. By adopting a more approachable and collaborative behavior, my team members will reduce their negative perceptions of me and thus help neutralize resistance.
Behavior Modeling
Behavior modeling inspires character change by watching others do it and imitating their actions. The technique will be instrumental in solving the problem of missed targets. Most of the members who post low sales accuse me of being out of touch with reality. To solve this, I will join them to demonstrate and share my experience, which I believe can influence the performance of members.
Reinforcement/Schedules of Reinforcement
The technique will be applicable in solving the low motivation problem. Introducing scheduled rewards is vital in inspiring members. Regular outing events after every quarter would help improve team cohesiveness, thus boosting overall enthusiasm. In addition, cash and other rewards used in regular intervals can help keep the group focused. Therefore, I would use scheduled reinforcements to inspire and sustain member motivation.
Punishment
Punishment is characterized by reprimands that can show cause and withdrawal of one’s benefits. While this technique might produce desired results in solving the identified problems in my group, it is not effective. Any form of punishment is likely to escalate the current issues leading to more disgruntled members. The technique as a behavioral deterrent only increases fear among the members rather than leading to desirable behavior.
Conclusion
In conclusion, group leaders should work towards building effective and responsive teams. Competent leaders should identify problems affecting their groups and take preventive and curative measures. The science of behaviorism suggests some techniques that can be used to modify behavior. Classical conditional, behavior shaping, behavior modeling, and reinforcement are effective inspiring and sustaining positive behavior. While some organizations utilize punishment, this technique should be avoided as it only creates fear. Overall, group leaders have a responsibility of keeping members cohesive and focused on the shared objectives."
"Defining a historical context of juvenile delinquency studies can provide valuable information about society’s progress concerning juvenile delinquency in such aspects, as parental responsibility. Comparing the acts that were acknowledged as juvenile delinquency in ancient times and modern society can determine whether current policies effectively prevent youth from misbehavior. This essay will compare how juvenile delinquency was perceived in Ancient Greece with the way modern society approaches juvenile offenders.
Firstly, searching for the historical origins of the juvenile delinquency concept could quickly become confusing because, historically, such a concept only occurred at the beginning of the modern era. While there is no significant data on youth misbehavior in ancient times, some available sources suggest that misbehavior was encouraged among young men (Bates & Swan, 2021). In particular, because masculinity and physical power were highly appreciated in Ancient Greece, one could determine that the society was pushing male youth towards violent behavior.
Exposing the youth to violent behavior and stories from a young age contributed to the unruly behavior of youth In Ancient Greece. According to Regoli et al. (2020), many stories from Ancient Greek culture focus on complicated parents’ relationships with their children that end with the killing of the children. Therefore, the author suggested that juvenile delinquency was sourced in one’s relationships with parents. While other sources suggest that in punishment measures, youth were treated as adults, according to Bates and Swan (2021), the issue of juvenile delinquency could not occur at that time due to close family connections. Furthermore, as corporal punishments were common in families at that time, the state did not have to define specific punishments for youth misbehavior. The only policy related to juvenile delinquency existing in ancient Greece was the law that prohibited the youth in ancient Greece from beating their parents. Thus, for example, in cases where a young man committed misbehavior, he was primarily responsible for his parents, and they decided the punishment measures, which mainly featured corporal punishment.
Exploration of the historical context of juvenile delinquency in the ancient period helps define one significant difference in parental engagement in modern society. In ancient Greece, the state encouraged parental responsibility for the child’s misbehavior, and parents could choose the punitive measures themselves. On the other hand, parental engagement in juvenile delinquency is limited in modern society. Moreover, parents, educational institutions, society, and media are acknowledged as responsible for the delinquent behavior of juvenile offenders.
Furthermore, considering the punishment measures, the corporal punishment commonly used in ancient times proved ineffective in the long run. According to Finkelhor et al. (2019), corporal punishment can result in poor development outcomes, such as mental health problems and subsequent aggression. In the last fifty years, the rate of children subjected to corporal punishment significantly decreased (Finkelhor et al., 2019). In modern times, common penalties for juvenile offenders include treatment and counseling, fines, or mandated community service hours. For example, in cases where a young man committed misbehavior, he is accountable to the authorities and will be judged depending on the severity of his actions. Lastly, the punishment measures for juvenile delinquency in modern society will never include corporal methods.
In conclusion, this essay explored the historical context of juvenile delinquency and compared how the state approached juvenile delinquency in ancient and modern times. The essay defined that young Greeks were exposed to violent behavior from an early age in ancient Greece, and many had problematic relationships with their parents. Moreover, as the state held parents accountable for the children’s misbehavior, parents were the ones who chose the punishment measures, often resorting to corporal punishment. In modern times, the state prohibits corporal punishments due to their ineffectiveness and limits parental engagement in juvenile delinquency, and offenders are judged based on the severity of their actions."
"The ADRB1 gene mutation has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its profound impact on sleep patterns in humans. This genetic variation in the ADRB1 gene, which codes for the beta-1 adrenergic receptor, has been linked to various sleep disorders and disturbances, highlighting its significance in understanding the complexities of sleep regulation.
Sleep plays a vital role in maintaining overall health and well-being. Disruptions in sleep patterns can have a range of detrimental effects, including impaired cognitive function, increased risk of chronic diseases, and diminished quality of life. The ADRB1 gene mutation has been found to disrupt the delicate balance of sleep regulation, leading to both physiological and behavioral alterations in affected individuals.
One of the main mechanisms through which the ADRB1 gene mutation affects sleep patterns is by altering the responsiveness of the beta-1 adrenergic receptor to adenosine, a neurotransmitter that promotes sleep. This mutation reduces the receptor's sensitivity to adenosine, leading to increased wakefulness and difficulty falling asleep. Consequently, individuals with this genetic variation often experience insomnia and have trouble maintaining a consistent sleep-wake cycle.
Furthermore, the ADRB1 gene mutation has also been associated with an increased risk of sleep apnea, a condition characterized by recurrent interruptions in breathing during sleep. This mutation affects the regulation of upper airway tone, making affected individuals more susceptible to airway collapse during sleep. Sleep apnea not only disrupts sleep quality but also poses significant health risks, including cardiovascular complications and increased mortality rates.
Understanding the significance of the ADRB1 gene mutation in sleep regulation can offer valuable insights into developing targeted treatments for sleep disorders. Researchers have increasingly focused on developing pharmacological interventions that can modulate the activity of the beta-1 adrenergic receptor, aiming to restore normal sleep patterns in affected individuals. By identifying the specific molecular pathways affected by this mutation, personalized and more effective therapies can be developed, ultimately providing relief to those impacted by sleep disorders.
In conclusion, the ADRB1 gene mutation holds great significance in understanding the intricate mechanisms underlying sleep regulation in humans. Its impact on sleep patterns, through alterations in adenosine responsiveness and increased vulnerability to sleep apnea, highlights the need for further research into developing targeted treatments for sleep disorders. Only through an extensive understanding of the ADRB1 gene mutation can we hope to unlock the secrets of sleep and improve the lives of individuals afflicted by sleep disturbances."
"Nowadays, there is a rapid development of technologies in many spectra of human life. Modern developments’ main task is making a man’s life convenient and safe. However, it is also essential to remember the impact of human life on nature and the environment. Thus, the development of electronic vehicles provides additional comfort for movement and positively affects the environment. With the evolution of industry and traffic systems, one should understand that human influence on nature has become destructive. It is primarily due to the consequences of the development of transportation, especially cars, which has become a cause for concern and elaboration of alternatives. In particular, electric vehicles are gaining popularity as a replacement for internal combustion engines. Electric cars are better for the future due to the absence of negative impact on the environment since not have harmful substances emission.
Carbon dioxide emissions, the main reason for which is the widespread use of vehicles with internal combustion engines, have a negative impact on the environment. It is formulated not only by air pollution but also by the destructive effect on the atmosphere. In turn, it has an effect on the climate, namely on the increase in average temperature, since the layers of the atmosphere have a protective function. Thus, the technologies of electric vehicles are essential to the automotive industry and the user due to better fuel economy and positive environmental impact (Mi and Masrur 11). In other words, electric cars will save humanity from the threats of warming-related cataclysms and help in the economic aspect. Electric cars reduce fuel consumption, which will positively impact the exhaustive energy sources issue.
The main argument for the necessity to replace cars with internal combustion engines with electric ones is the degree of influence of vehicles on the environment. Moreover, one should consider the number of engines and other types of vehicles: buses, trucks, and tractors. Passenger cars rank first in terms of the number of units used, respectively, having the most significant impact. In addition, passenger cars are ahead of other types of transport in terms of quantity, namely, airplanes, ships, and rail transport. Although passenger cars are used in most cases for trips up to 200 kilometers, they still have a significant degree of negative impact. It is stated by the fact that the number of simultaneously used units is large, which leads to the accumulation of emissions.
Fig. 1. Chart Demonstrating Emission Degree in EU
All modes of transport, except for road transport, have lower carbon dioxide emissions, and the smallest share goes to rail transport. As can be seen in Figure 1, road transportation has 72% of overall emissions, and 60,7% goes to automobiles (See Fig. 1 above) (MLA 8th, 3). One may also notice that water and air transport have a fairly high share of emissions, although less compared to road transport. Thus, one may identify that replacing internal combustion engines with electric ones will significantly improve the situation.
In regards to car-related issues, one should consider the long-term implications and results. It includes two aspects: the impact on the environment and the use of natural resources. In recent years there has been a significant increase in oil extraction (Vilches and Jonatan 164). This is primarily due to the increased demand for gasoline extracted from oil. In turn, it is connected with the growth in the number of cars, especially personal ones. In other words, one may notice that the existing indicators showing the degree of negative impact on the environment may increase. Thus, the prospect of switching to electric engines, at least in passenger cars, is an effective way to solve the problem in the long term. At the same time, it will affect the two above-mentioned aspects, namely the impact on nature and the problem of using resources.
Electric cars have another advantage in terms of consumables, energy savings, and machine functionality. It was possible to identify that the technologies of the interaction of mechanisms in electric cars, which reduce the degree of friction, could reduce energy losses by 18-40% (Holmberg and Erdemir 2). It is connected with the principle of operation of electric cars, namely the reduction of the pistons and levers quality, which wear out quickly in usual cars. In turn, applying electricity will reduce emissions and resource utilization for the construction of these parts.
It was also possible to establish the advantage of electric cars in terms of carbon dioxide emissions compared to conventional cars. In combustion engine cars, the CO2 emission is 4.5 higher compared to electric cars (Holmberg and Erdemir 3). One may notice that the degree of difference is significant, considering the number and degree of modern vehicles usage. Moreover, the electricity used to charge electric cars may come only from inexhaustible sources of energy in the future. Green energy, or energy produced with the help of natural forces, cancels the impact on the number of existing resources. It includes energy from wind, water, ebb and flow, sunlight, as well as geothermal energy, which is obtained using geothermal sources.
Moreover, nowadays one has some outlines of switching to electricity not only in cars. Electric vehicle technology is applicable for locomotives, off-road vehicles (construction and mining vehicles), ships, and to some extent to, aircraft (Mi and Masrur 13). Certainly, it is necessary to apply technologies that are not yet available to people for such developments. However, it will be possible in the future, which in turn would entail a revolution in the context of energy use. Additionally, one will significantly improve the condition of the environment due to the fact that the number of emissions will approach zero. It would solve the climate issues and improve the air condition, which would positively affect the health of the population and flora and fauna. In other words, the use of electric transport has local and general long-term advantages.
The application of electric engines will reduce the need to process materials and transport them to extract fuel and gasoline. Similar to burning gasoline in car engines, the refining oil process emits carbon dioxide. Moreover, a significant amount of pollution of the world’s oceans was provoked by waste from oil refining and accidents during the transportation of oil or fuel. Oil spots resulting from spills due to accidents have a devastating effect on the flora and fauna of the ocean. Additionally, it negatively affects the microflora of the sea, which can lead to long-term negative consequences. Besides, harmful substances settled on the surface of the water due to fuel burnout during water transportation also negatively affect both the condition of the water and flora and fauna. Thus, the transition to electric cars has a positive impact not only on the air, usage of resources, and energy but also on the world’s oceans.
Reducing car emissions around the world will have a significant positive impact on air quality, acid rains, smog, and climate change. The health effects of vehicle emissions are also of concern. Car noise is harmful to people since it affects not only hearing but also the development of hypertension. Carbon and nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, compounds containing sulfur formulate the dangerous mix that one consumes every day on the streets of one’s city. Road transport’s other environmental impacts include traffic congestion and urban sprawl that can occupy natural habitats and agricultural land. The exhaust gases of cars contain a large amount of lead, which, together with salts of other metals, enters the soil, surface, and ground waters and is absorbed by plants. During the operation of a car with internal combustion engines, the sources of emissions of harmful substances are exhaust gases and uncontrolled spillage of operating materials onto the ground.
To conclude, electric cars are better for the future for a number of reasons, both local and general long-term causes. Modern researches, as well as the work of scientists, formulate arguments for the positive impact of electric cars on the environment and on the future life. Moreover, it is possible to switch to electric engines not only in cars, which provoke the most of emissions among transportation types. There are plans to use electricity instead of fuel in trains, ships, and airplanes. It was found that the difference between the impact on the environment and air of electric cars and ones with combustion engines is significant. Moreover, it will have positive consequences in terms of the use of energy and natural resources."

"In today's multicultural societies, the concept of social equality is of paramount importance, particularly as it relates to ethnic minorities. By critically examining the model minority myth and the assimilation of Japanese Americans, we can gain valuable insights into the impact of social equality on these communities. Additionally, highlighting the significance of maintaining cultural identity while embracing diversity, and the need for shared learning to eliminate discrimination, we can further develop our understanding of this complex issue.
The model minority myth, often ascribed to Asian Americans, has perpetuated the idea that certain minority groups are more successful than others due to their work ethic and cultural values. However, this myth not only oversimplifies the experiences of ethnic minorities but also erases their diverse backgrounds and struggles. By analyzing this concept, it becomes apparent that it hinders social equality by reinforcing stereotypes and obscuring the structural barriers faced by marginalized communities.
The assimilation of Japanese Americans during World War II is a poignant case study that illustrates the impact of social equality on ethnic minorities. The internment of Japanese Americans and subsequent assimilation policies forced them to abandon their cultural heritage and adopt Western customs. While this resulted in some degree of upward mobility for the community, it came at the cost of cultural loss and continued discrimination.
Maintaining cultural identity while embracing diversity is essential for a genuinely equal society. It is crucial to recognize that true equality involves celebrating and valuing the rich cultural heritage of all individuals, particularly ethnic minorities. Encouraging cultural preservation allows minority communities to assert their identities, fostering a sense of belonging and empowerment.
Additionally, shared learning plays a vital role in eliminating discrimination. By embracing diverse perspectives, experiences, and knowledge, we can challenge our own biases and foster empathy and understanding. This necessitates a collective effort from individuals, institutions, and communities to actively engage in dialogue, education, and advocacy.
In conclusion, the concept of social equality has a profound impact on ethnic minorities. Analyzing the model minority myth and the assimilation of Japanese Americans exposes the flaws and repercussions of inadequate social equality. By prioritizing cultural identity while embracing diversity and promoting shared learning, we can make significant strides towards eliminating discrimination and building a more equitable society.

"The devastation and challenges of World War II were tremendous. The U.S. faced severe and significant objectives that would define the future state of America and European countries. It was essential for the U.S. to oppose Communist expansion in Europe and Asia, so there were specific policies that addressed this aim, and evaluating their efficiency and success may provide valuable insights.
First, it is essential to discuss the policy of containment that was adopted by America and its allies. The purpose of this strategy was to prevent the spread of communism and respond to the Soviet Union’s moves to expand its influence in a number of countries by providing struggling nations with more funding (Corbett et al., 2014). It is possible to say that this policy was effective because the U.S. managed to protect several countries from being coerced into communism.
The second successful policy is the Marshall Plan aimed at several positive changes. The main idea behind this policy was to provide financial support to the struggling European nations, giving them $13 billion in economic aid (Corbett et al., 2014). The countries that received financial help were united and managed to undercut the political popularity of communism. The third relatively successful reform was the Vietnam conflict (“Domino theory,” 2018). In this war, South Vietnam and the U.S. acted against North Vietnam’s communist government (Corbett et al., 2014). Though the U.S. did not manage to protect South Vietnam from communist forces, its spread to the rest of Southeast Asia was blocked, and it is possible to consider this reform effective. Finally, one would state that the United States should not have feared international communist subversion during the Cold War era. The reason is that America’s strength allowed it to resist communist forces, and the fear could have undermined the nation’s confidence."

Overall, the conflicting desires and dreams within the characters of A Raisin in the Sun not only highlight their individual struggles but also shed light on the broader societal issues of the time. By navigating these conflicts, the Younger family comes to understand the importance of unity and support, leading them towards a collective path of striving for a better future."
"This essay will explain the value and sexuality of women in the Islamic religion compared to Christianity. One central concern is the deflation of individuals or the suppression of people under the defense of religion. Religion has emerged to be a central tool of abuse in terms of treating different gender. Throughout Islamic holy books, women are subject to oppression, which Allah accepts. This is almost similar to Christianity since they devaluate the same women (The Holy Bible). However, there are incredible differences that I will be addressing in this essay. My argument is that women in the Islamic religion and Christianity have different values and treatments.
Firstly, I will analyze and elaborate on the motives of oppression directly from the holy books. I will analyze how some pages of Hadith and Quran justify oppression towards women as acceptable by Allah (Moore, 2017). I will analyze how this is different from the Bible since the cruelest view of females in the Bible is more gracious than that of women in Islam. Any discussion regarding the religious justification for the way men, children, or women are treated is mostly justified through texts from the holy books
I will address how women are treated in service in the church and what they can offer in the Mosques. The Islamic religion has a diverse understanding of the value of women since some view women as subservient while others view them as equals. Women in most Christian churches are viewed as equal, whereas in some churches, they are teachers of the word, nuns, and fully participate in the ministry (Ali, 2018). In the Islamic religion, women do not have a position in their church or their service and activities in the Mosque.
My essay will address the position of women in marriage in both religions. Men in the Islamic faith can be involved in a polygamous marriage which is most advisable. A man can marry several women but not more than four if they can provide and treat them equally. In Christianity, the Bible discusses polygamous marriages but does not advise men to polygamous families (Lassen, 2021). Most Christian churches advocate for monogamous families. I will address how a woman is expected to behave in the family and the role they are expected to play in their homes in both religions.
Finally, I will address the differences and similarities in women’s submission in Islamic religion and Christianity. In the Islamic religion, followers are made to believe that God was male, and hence they should submit to males since they have the power. The male gender is more respected in the Islamic religion, majorly because God is believed to be male, and hence as they submit to God, they should submit to any male (Moore, 2017). On the other hand, Christians believe that the Bible advocates men as the priest of the home and that Eve was commanded to submit to Adam, and hence women are required to submit to their husbands.
Religion is the power and the reason behind most abuse that happens to women. This essay will answer the question: is it true that women in Christianity and Islamic religions are devalued? I will conclude my essay by saying how things change through education and different forms of education. Feminists are emerging both in the Islamic religion and Christianity. They try to ensure that women are treated equally and valued just as men are valued both in religion and the community."

"“Edges of the Rainbow” was created by Michael Delsol and Haruku Shinozaki in 2017. It is a collection of photographs and personal stories of LGBT+Q community representatives from different parts of Japan. Michael Delsos is a French photographer who depicts the people connected with art creation, and his pictures are published in magazines and newspapers. He also participates in the exhibits where Delsol presents his work separately or with other photographers. Haruku Shinozaki is a journalist, and he explores the marginal communities and minorities in Japan, particularly LGBTQ+ community members. This book applies to a specific audience, such as social activists, representatives of minority groups, demographic researchers, and those who are interested to learn more about the experience of the marginal communities in Japan.
The purpose of the work is to tell the audience about the experience of minorities in one of the most conformist and traditional countries in the world. The title of the book means the two different sides of the LGBTQ+ culture in Japan, implying that, on the one hand, it is a general topic that appears in books, shows, anime, the Japanese cartoons (Delsol & Shinozaki, 2017). On the other hand, underneath it, there is a certain amount of prejudice and conservatism, which is clearly depicted by the name “Edges of the Rainbow.”
The confessions of the people whose stories are told on the pages of the book are intriguing and fascinating since, eventually, the person of different professions and class belonging can represent the LGBTQ+ community. Delsol and Shinozaki (2017) mention an Episcopal priest that from a very young age, was very religious and decided to hold services for the LGBTQ+ parishioners so they would have a safe space where they could embrace their spirituality. Another example is an initiative called akta that works to provide sexual education for people and spread awareness about HIV/AIDS prevention (Delsol, Shinozaki 2017). They also have literature and other informational resources on the LGBTQ+ topic and welcome queer people that seek help or assistance in any personal situation.
People of different sexualities and genders are much more diverse than it demonstrates the typical stereotypes. One of the main thoughts of Delsol and Shinozaki (2017) is that society has the image of an LGBTQ+ person as someone extravagant in bright clothes and unusual appearance, but mostly they are regular people. This can be a priest from the local church, a school teacher, or a bus driver – they are all different, and each has unique history and personality. The aim of the book is to show the world the life of LGBTQ+ people and their way of self-representation in places where society is considered to be traditional or conservative towards the subject.
The work dedicated to the difficulties of the life of minorities in a country with a strong traditional culture is a real protest. The lives of ordinary people captured in it with their difficulties teach us to be more tolerant of others because severe pain can be hidden behind a smiling mask. Although the inner strength of the stories told, “Edges of the Rainbow” cannot teach us what to do to improve the situation of these people in a global sense. “Edges of the Rainbow” fits into the ASAN 201 concept as it also helps to understand Asian culture through a multidisciplinary approach, depicting the social side of the question. Despite the provocative theme, the authors describe life with honor and dignity, as it should be in Japanese culture. According to Delsol and Shinozaki (2017), the book lifts the veil of the world, which was previously not customary talked about. One thing is clear: this work has made a significant contribution to efforts to improve a lot of minorities and talk about a topic that has long been taboo in Japanese society."
"Advancements in the treatment of melanoma have greatly improved the potential for long-term remission, particularly with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors and adjuvant therapies. These treatments have shown promising results in improving survival rates for patients at different stages of melanoma. By exploring the case of Mr. B, we can delve into the implications of these treatments and discuss the evidence supporting their efficacy.
Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that arises from the pigment-producing cells, known as melanocytes. It is notorious for its aggressive nature and potential to metastasize. However, with the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab, remarkable advancements have been made in the treatment of advanced melanoma.
Immune checkpoint inhibitors work by enhancing the body's immune response against cancer cells. They inhibit the activity of proteins called immune checkpoints, which restrict the immune system's ability to recognize and target cancer cells. By blocking these checkpoints, the immune system is unleashed to attack and destroy the tumor cells.
In the case of Mr. B, a 55-year-old melanoma patient diagnosed with stage IV metastatic melanoma, treatment with a combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors led to a significant improvement in his prognosis. Studies have shown that the use of pembrolizumab and nivolumab in patients with advanced melanoma can result in durable responses and long-term remission. In a study by Robert et al., the overall response rate to pembrolizumab was 33%, with a median overall survival of 23 months, providing hope for patients like Mr. B.
Adjuvant therapies, which are administered alongside primary treatments, have also played a crucial role in improving survival rates in patients with melanoma. In particular, targeted therapies and combination therapies have shown promising outcomes. Targeted therapies, such as BRAF and MEK inhibitors, specifically target the genetic mutations present in melanoma cells. These inhibitors have been successful in patients with BRAF gene mutations, including Mr. B, leading to higher response rates and longer progression-free survival.
Furthermore, combination therapies that combine immune checkpoint inhibitors with targeted therapies have shown even more impressive results. For instance, the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib, BRAF and MEK inhibitors respectively, with immunotherapy has demonstrated significant improvements in overall response rates and progression-free survival. This combination therapy has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of melanoma patients with BRAF mutations.
Overall, advancements in melanoma treatment, particularly the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors and adjuvant therapies, have significantly increased the potential for long-term remission and improved survival rates. These treatments have shown promising results in patients at different stages of melanoma, both in terms of improved overall response rates and increased overall survival. The case of Mr. B exemplifies the efficacy of these treatments, with his favorable response to immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies. Continued research and advancements in this field offer hope for melanoma patients, as these treatments pave the way for better outcomes and potentially higher cure rates."
"Introduction:
Overpopulation refers to the condition when the population of a particular species, especially humans, exceeds the carrying capacity of the environment. This phenomenon has adverse environmental and societal effects that necessitate urgent action to control growth. This essay will explore the detrimental impacts of overpopulation on both the environment and society, highlighting the crucial need to regulate population growth for the conservation of natural resources.
Body:
1. Adverse Environmental Effects:
a) Resource Depletion: Overpopulation strains limited resources such as water, food, and energy, leading to increased consumption rates that surpass the Earth's replenishment capabilities. As more resources are exploited, the risk of depleting forests, fisheries, and non-renewable resources becomes higher.
b) Habitat Destruction: To accommodate growing populations, natural habitats are frequently converted into residential, industrial, and agricultural areas. Deforestation, urbanization, and land degradation not only destroy ecosystems but also disrupt vital ecological processes and threaten biodiversity.
2. Societal Consequences:
a) Strain on Infrastructure: Overpopulated areas face tremendous pressure on infrastructure, including housing, transportation, and healthcare systems. Insufficient infrastructure can lead to overcrowding, unsanitary living conditions, strained public services, and increased vulnerability to disasters.
b) Poverty and Inequality: High population densities often exacerbate poverty and income inequality, as limited resources are usually inadequately distributed. Unequal access to education, healthcare, and opportunities can hamper societal development and perpetuate social disparities.
3. Conservation Imperatives:
a) Sustainable Resource Management: Controlling overpopulation enables better management of resources, ensuring their long-term availability. By reducing consumption rates and enhancing sustainable practices, societies can mitigate the risk of resource exhaustion and promote a healthier environment.
b) Environmental Preservation: By curbing population growth, proactive measures can be taken to protect and restore ecosystems. Preserving natural habitats and biodiversity is crucial for maintaining ecological balance, the provision of ecosystem services, and mitigating climate change effects.
Conclusion:
In light of the adverse environmental and societal effects associated with overpopulation, it is evident that controlling population growth is vital for the conservation of natural resources. By implementing effective family planning initiatives, promoting education, and addressing socio-economic inequalities, societies can strike a balance between population size and resource availability. Failure to address overpopulation could result in irreversible damage to our environment, hindering our ability to sustainably meet the needs of current and future generations. It is, therefore, imperative that we tackle this critical issue to ensure a future that thrives harmoniously with nature."
"COVID-19 prevention management and vaccine distribution have been some of the most discussed topics over the last year. The United States has been hit harder than most countries, and it is essential to provide effective countermeasures to the virus spread. From these considerations, many experts believe that the Federal government should have acquired and distributed more test kits and vaccines. At present, Biden recognizes the pandemic problem but emphasizes the States’ importance, “There is no federal solution. This gets solved at a state level” (Franck, 2021, para. 5). In other words, government involvement could only prevent further pandemic spread with the appropriate state support and cooperation from civilians. Most experts recognize the effectiveness of vaccines, particularly to relieve the symptoms of the strain (WHO, 2022). Therefore, the solution only at the Federal level would most likely have little effect, and it is vital to raise public awareness concerning the dangers of COVID-19 and the benefits of vaccination.
Concerning Biden’s remark about the unexpected development of COVID-19 in late 2021, I can partially agree with the statement. The Omicron variant, which was first discovered and named on 26 November 2021, is a more contagious strain than previous mutations (WHO, 2021). Thus, Omicron caused a drastic spike in contamination cases and led to increased demand for test kits (UC Davis Health, 2022). Much research needs to be done about the Omicron variant, and this development was relatively unexpected. Nevertheless, the country is much more prepared in 2022, compared to the initial stages of the pandemic, and Biden has asserted to buy 500 million test kits (BBC News, 2021). Ultimately, the Federal government, States, and people should be cooperative and work together to prevent the further development of the Omicron variant."
"Feedback is usually a review or statement of opinion about the service provided or the work done. This type of communication is common both in relations between an employee and a client, and an employee and an employer. The importance of such a tool is due to the fact that it contributes to the timely adjustment of the employee’s actions so that he best achieves the goal. In addition, with the help of feedback, you can confirm the correctness of the actions of the individual. It is important to note that there are both positive and negative types of such a relationship, which differ in their goals. So, if a positive review is intended to encourage the process performed by an employee, then a negative one is used to change the vector of work. An example would be when a worker receives a message that a task was completed successfully, they can move on to the next step.
Here you can clearly see that the employee is going in the right direction, which means the feedback is positive. If it happens that the review indicates the need to redo the work, since errors or shortcomings are exposed, then such a review is treated as negative (Primeast US, 2016). It is necessary to choose the right way to leave a review, namely, to observe the correct subordination form, business tone, not to switch to insults or jokes. This will allow both criticism and praise to be constructive so that it can be handled without putting the worker out of action. It is also worth receiving feedback in a balanced, calm and not tired state in order to control reactions and emotions. An employee, as a rule, does not know in advance what kind of feedback they sent him, and in order not to break loose, it is necessary to be ready for anything. In addition, it is often appropriate to practice remote feedback to avoid interpersonal conflicts. This is done through corporate mail or special sites for leaving reviews."
"Vitamin D plays a significant role in regulating phosphorus and calcium absorption in our bones. Far from this regulation, the nutrient is also essential in facilitating communication among cells within our bodies. The other significance of vitamin D in the body is that it can be manufactured when exposed to sunlight. These characteristics distinguish the vitamin from other nutrients since it can be obtained from sun exposure apart from food and dietary supplements. Compared to other nutrients, what characterizes vitamin D makes it a super nutrient.
What sets vitamin D apart from the other nutrients and arguably makes it a super nutrient is that, unlike other nutrients, it can be obtained by exposure to the sun. Exposure to the sun is the most effective way the vitamin can be obtained (Klioze, 2017). The potential magic associated with the nutrient is that it acts as a potential hormone in over a dozen of cells and tissues throughout the body. In so doing, the vitamin helps the body regulate essential gene expression and rapidly activates the already-expressed proteins and enzymes (Klioze, 2017). For example, in the heart, vitamin D binds to a certain receptor of the same vitamin, generating a calming protective effect.
With a considerable amount of research on the nutrient focusing on the significance of the vitamin on overall health, some epidemiological studies have uncovered a deficiency torrent of vitamin D. Based on the read report; findings show that between 50 and 75 percent of Americans have insufficient vitamin D levels in their bodies (Feldman et al., 2018). A growing body of evidence shows that an individual’s chance for optimal health is increased if the nutrient levels are adequate and vice versa. However, important to note is that “Just because low vitamin D and disease are correlated does not mean that one causes the other” (Feldman et al., 2018). Contrary, the same scientific reports have shown that approximately 75 percent of breast and colon cancer can be prevented by maintaining sufficient vitamin D levels (Klioze, 2017). Several reasons exist why vitamin deficiency is widespread in the U.S. and the world over.
Unlike other vitamins, vitamin D is one of the few nutrients the body can make. However, compared to the others, 40 percent of body exposure to ultraviolet B rays, between 15 and 30 minutes, results in the production of 20,000 IU of the nutrient (Klioze, 2017). Shocking statistics reveal that significantly few foods and supplements have the same amounts of vitamin D occurring naturally. Except for sardines, mackerel, salmon, and tunas, daily consumption of any other food results in insufficient vitamin D amounts in the body. Ironically, a one-eight-ounce of milk glass can only give 100 IU of the nutrient with a similar amount acquired in a bowl of fortified cereals (Feldman et al., 2018). Combined, both a glass of milk and cereals can only generate 200 IU of vitamin D, a one-tenth amount that can be acquired from thirty minutes under the sun (Feldman et al., 2018). Hence, it becomes physically impossible to eat your way out of vitamin D deficiency.
Vitamin D is arguably fast becoming a super nutrient, with its importance growing exponentially in the past few decades. Scientific research shows that insufficient vitamin D can be associated with widespread health consequences. However, as shown, just because low vitamin D and disease are correlated does not mean that one causes the other. Contrary, by maintaining sufficient vitamin D levels, some major health complications can be prevented."

"In order to prevent an offense and draw up a protocol on an administrative offense, the authorized person has the right to apply such a measure to ensure production as the detention of a vehicle. This happens if it is impossible to draw it up on the spot of detecting an administrative offense, ensuring timely and correct consideration of the case and execution of the resolution. In case of violations of the rules of operation, use of the vehicle, and its management, the detention of the vehicle is applied. This is due to placement in the nearest specially designated protected place (in a specialized parking lot), and storage there until the cause of detention is eliminated.
The costs of moving and storing a detained vehicle, with the exception of vehicles, are reimbursed by the person who committed the offense. The cost of storing a detained vehicle is charged for each full hour of its stay in a specialized parking lot from the moment the detained vehicle is placed in a specialized parking lot until it is returned to the owner. Payment for the cost of moving and storing a detained vehicle is carried out within the time limits and at the rates established by the authorized executive authority. The prices of the parking lot owner, which should be involved in payment, should also be taken into account. Thus, attention should also be paid to the fact that Outback Insurance Company was notified by the parking lot owner and by the police. However, it should be noted that the company “took no action to take possession of the vehicle”.
Consequently, they were fully aware of the situation and had to take appropriate measures. The fee for the car storage services should be charged to the owner of the vehicle, who has not fulfilled their obligation to receive the car from the special parking lot, while the storage services have been provided in full. From the analysis of the above legal norms, it follows that legally significant circumstances for the correct resolution of this dispute are determining the number of reimbursable expenses incurred by a person in connection with the storage of a car. However, it should be noted that Outback Insurance Company has the right to demand a revision of the cost of payment in accordance with the median market value. This is necessary in order to assess the correctness of the cost of compensation that Ron Dexter requires.
In addition, it should be taken into account the fact that the car was seized on February 14, and the company received notification only on May 8. This fact is essential in order to understand what rights Outback Insurance Company could lose due to untimely notification. It is important to understand that if the owner applies to a special parking lot for the car’s return on the first day of storage, they will not have to pay for the car’s storage since payment is made for a full day of hold. Thus, the company has the right to request a revision of the cost of storage, which is required by Ron Dexter. The correct solution here is to demand payment from the date of receipt of the notification by the police. The conclusion from this case may be the fact that the Outback Insurance Company must pay the cost of storing the vehicle. However, the requested $15,510 is not a valid and fair amount, since several factors listed above must be taken into account."
"Introduction:
Mesopotamia and Egypt, two ancient civilizations located in close geographical proximity, developed distinctly unique religious and political systems. This essay aims to compare and contrast these systems and explore their contributions to the cultural and intellectual development of each region.
Religious Systems:
In Mesopotamia, a polytheistic belief system dominated the culture. The Babylonians and Assyrians worshipped a pantheon of gods, with each city-state having its own patron deity. In contrast, Egypt embraced a polytheistic concept where several deities were worshipped, but the Pharaoh held the ultimate religious authority, being seen as a divine ruler.
Political Systems:
Mesopotamia was characterized by the rule of various city-states, each governed by a king, who held absolute power. These city-states often engaged in conflicts and alliances, leading to a fragmented political landscape. On the other hand, Egypt was a unified kingdom under the rule of a single Pharaoh, who was regarded as a divine intermediary and responsible for maintaining order through ma'at (cosmic harmony).
Contributions to Cultural and Intellectual Development:
The religious systems of both Mesopotamia and Egypt played crucial roles in shaping their respective cultures and intellectual development. In Mesopotamia, the concept of kingship being divinely appointed led to the development of complex bureaucracy, legal codes (notably the Code of Hammurabi), and advancements in mathematics and astronomy. Additionally, Mesopotamians believed in the concept of an afterlife, leading to the construction of elaborate tombs and funerary practices.
In Egypt, the divine authority of the Pharaoh fostered a sense of stability, leading to extensive architectural achievements exemplified in the construction of pyramids and temples. The religious system influenced art, with depictions of gods and goddesses adorning temples and tombs. Moreover, the development of a written script, hieroglyphics, enabled the preservation of religious and historical records, contributing to intellectual advancements in areas such as medicine, mathematics, and astronomy.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, although both Mesopotamia and Egypt display unique characteristics within their religious and political systems, they share commonalities in their contributions to cultural and intellectual development. Mesopotamia's polytheism and the divine authority of kings drove advancements in governance and sciences, whereas Egypt's centralized authority under the Pharaoh led to monumental architectural achievements and the preservation of knowledge through writing systems. These systems created a foundation for future civilizations, offering insights into the cultural and intellectual richness of these ancient societies."

"The editing in the first episode of the series Money Heist is in line with its thrilling plot and rapid action. In the first scene, as the character gets ready to exit her vehicle, the editing is quick, focusing on the items she is picking up. Similarly, the camera often focuses on objects, leading the viewer towards the items that will become an essential part of the narrative. For example, one can see the ringing phone before it is picked up. Moreover, the show uses rapid editing with close-ups and the use of objects that identify characters – guns, money, and other items that show one’s motives or their identifying trait.
The characters’ close-ups are dynamic, often using dolly shots to slowly expose the background or move with the character. This way, the camera does not stop as long as the characters move or the whole room is exposed. When they stop, the editing is as rapid as the conversation between people. In monologues, the dolly is used again to keep the tension as the series requires a serious tone in many scenes dealing with life-or-death scenarios. Notably, the character in a close-up is rarely placed in the center of the screen. The shot is divided into thirds vertically – and the characters stay in the first or third part.
Hand-held shots are also used, and they are consistent with scenes where characters feel insecure, aggressive, scared, or exposed. Moreover, when the characters are walking, the camera moves at the same speed. The change between steady dolly movements and hand-held “shaky” shots is needed to juxtapose moments focused on action and interpersonal drama. Moreover, tension is the primary source of emotion, and the editing keeps enough suspense by using close-ups of characters rather than an overview of the whole room."
"Introduction (50 words)
In Lufkin's article on the impact of presenteeism in the era of pandemic and social transformations, the importance of recognizing true motives behind presenteeism and the effects of subconscious biases on employee relationships is highlighted. This essay delves into the role of halo and mere exposure effects in determining promotions and the potential drawbacks of basing career growth on physical presence rather than performance.
Body
1. Understanding the True Motives behind Presenteeism (100 words)
Presenteeism, defined as employees attending work despite being unwell, is often fueled by various underlying motives. Fear of job insecurity, a desire to portray commitment, or even an individual's need to feel a sense of belonging are prevalent in workplaces. Acknowledging these motives is crucial to address the root causes of presenteeism and create a healthy work environment that prioritizes employee well-being.
2. Subconscious Biases and Employee Relationships (100 words)
Subconscious biases play a significant role in shaping employee relationships, particularly when it comes to promotions. The halo effect occurs when positive traits or exceptional skills in one aspect of an employee's performance overshadow their shortcomings in other areas. Similarly, the mere exposure effect suggests that familiarity influences individuals' preferences and evaluations. These biases may lead to unfair promotions based on superficial characteristics or extensive physical presence rather than actual performance and competency.
3. The Potential Drawbacks of Relying on Physical Presence for Career Growth (100 words)
Basing career growth solely on physical presence rather than performance can have several drawbacks. Firstly, it undermines the meritocracy principle that should govern advancement in any organization. Employees who excel in their roles but are unable to maintain high physical presence might be overlooked for promotions, causing frustration and dissatisfaction. Moreover, it perpetuates biased workplace cultures and discourages work-life balance, ultimately hindering overall productivity and diminishing employee morale.
4. Mitigating the Halo and Mere Exposure Effects (100 words)
To minimize the detrimental impact of subconscious biases on employee relationships, organizations need to implement fair and transparent promotion processes. This includes establishing clear assessment criteria based on objective performance metrics rather than relying solely on subjective evaluations. Raising awareness among managers and employees about the existence of these biases is essential to encourage unbiased decision-making and foster a diverse and inclusive work environment.
Conclusion (50 words)
Recognizing the true motives behind presenteeism and understanding the effects of subconscious biases on employee relationships is crucial for organizations striving for fair career growth opportunities. By minimizing the influence of halo and mere exposure effects and shifting the focus towards individual performance, organizations can enhance employee satisfaction, productivity, and overall organizational success.

"The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka is a great story about a young man who transforms into a bug and is imprisoned in his own chamber as a result of apples thrown at him sticking in his casing. Georg Samka awakens in a surrealistic dream world, and he receives no sympathy from anyone, despite the fact that he has sacrificed his own aspirations for years so that his sister might study music at the Conservatory. His family members’ reactions to him and how they choose to deal with the situation betray their relationships with him, revealing what they actually feel about the young man.
While Gregor’s family has never shown affection for him, they did at least treat him as a human before his transformation; following his transformation, they have become progressively nasty and aloof. Gregor’s family tolerates him before his transformation since he takes over as the family’s breadwinner. They don’t have a particularly warm connection, but at least they show him some respect so that he may continue to support them. When they suspect he’ll be late for work, they double-check to make sure he arrives. When his father tries to wake his kid up, even if he doesn’t work, he has a warning in his voice.
His sister is the only one of his family that comes to his aid, inquiring if he is ill. She instantly tries to console and assist him in any way she can. Grete, the sister, begins collecting goods that she feels he will be interested in after his metamorphosis so that he can eat and feel comfortable, such as rotting vegetables, cheese, old leftovers, and hardened bones. Mrs. Samsa, his mother, is troubled by the transition, overcome with emotion and despair. She does her hardest to comfort and assist him, but she can’t stand looking at him. She tries her hardest to behave motherly in her sadness, but she has a hard time overcoming his appearance. Mr. Samsa, Gregor’s father, is unpleasant and rude to the point of becoming abusive. Mr. Samsa has grown accustomed to Gregor providing for his family by working for a living and paying for their survival. He is enraged at the shift, particularly since it means Gregor will no longer be able to assist them.
All the family members started to mistreat him after his transformation. With a newspaper, his father pursues him back into the room. Gregor’s father injures him later by throwing a piece of fruit at him, which causes an illness. Since Gregor can no longer work, his parents and sister have all taken up jobs to supplement his income. Grete, too, gradually loses sympathy for her brother. She was most likely his closest family member, yet caring for him is a strain for her. She eventually informs her parents that she wants Gregor gone. He determines that the best thing he can do for them is to die, and he does so.
To conclude, Gregor’s metamorphosis reflects a true approach of his family members to him. With the transformation, Gregor illustrates that he had a wish to be free of the duties that should be his father’s, his dislike for his profession and the drudgery that comes with it. His transformation shows Gregor’s anger towards family’s exploitation of him and their irresponsibility in not contributing to the family income."
"Article Summary
The article “ Anopheles stephensi Mosquitoes as Vectors of Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum, Horn of Africa” by Chali et al. (2019) compared the susceptibility of Plasmodium falciparum and Vivax infection between the An. stephensi and An. arabiensis mosquitoes. The study was conducted in the Awash Sebat Kilo region found in Ethiopia because of its high perennial malaria transmission. An experiment was conducted to establish the difference in infection status between the two species of mosquitoes. Adult An. stephensi and An. arabiensis mosquitoes reared from immature mosquitoes were fed from membrane feeders with fresh blood from the patients attending the Adama clinic. The feeding was done with blood infected with P. vivax and P. falciparum for 7 to 12 days. The mosquitoes’ midgets and salivary glands were dissected to examine the oocysts and sporozoites, respectively. A comparison of the infection status was done using logistic regression analysis. The differences in mosquito sources’ infectivity were examined using the Pitman test. Data analysis was done using the STATA version 13 and GraphPad Prism 5.3.
From the 85 aquatic habitats surveyed in the study, 75.3% of the larvae detected were from An. stephensi mosquitoes. The general proportion of blood-fed mosquitoes was higher for An. arabiensis (median 80.5%) than An. stephensi (median 53.5%, p<0.001) (Chali et al., 2019). However, the latter species reported a significantly higher infection with P. vivax (median 75.1%) compared to the former species (median 58.4%, p<0.042). An. stephensi mosquitoes showed higher odds of infection for an individual mosquito (OR=1.99, p<0.001) and higher numbers of oocysts per infected midgut (median 17) than the counterpart species (median 13, p<0.001). Also, a higher proportion of An. stephensi (51.8%) had a high sporozoite load and odds of detecting high sporozoite intensity from the salivary glands compared to An. arabiensis (31.1%). It was evident from the study that An. stephensi poses a higher risk for increased P. falciparum and P. vivax in Ethiopia compared to An. arabiensis .

Malaria prevalence in Africa remains a huge health concern that has a significant medical, social, and economic impact. The findings in this study provide insight into the infection status of P. vivax and P. falciparum and the transmission rate between the An. stephensi and An. arabiensis mosquitoes. This study indicates the risk factors of malaria within the local population of Ethiopia. These risk factors are generalizable to the African population. These findings will play a significant role in informing the effective malaria control strategies required to lower the rate of malaria transmission. The findings are critical for the establishment of treatment and diagnostic policies aimed at reducing the mortality and morbidity associated with malaria transmission by the Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes.
This research is critical to the World Health Organization and other organizations involved in the control and management of diseases. The findings can be used to develop more sensitive diagnostic tools that can help promote early detection and treatment of malaria infection among patients. As a result, adequate healthcare will be provided to those infected; thus, lowering the death rates. It is through these findings that effective countermeasures can be devised and deployed in different parts of Ethiopia and Africa. The findings can be used to provide public health awareness to populations in these regions. Eliminating aquatic water sources that promote the breeding of Anopheles mosquitoes will help the larger population contribute towards fight again malaria transmission. The application of the findings in this research can provide a remarkable improvement in health care and public health. Consequently, the adoption of health measures and control programs to lower malaria transmission has an enormous impact on human health, resulting in increased productivity of the population."
"Lewin's change theory and Roger's five-step theory are two prominent theories that address the process of implementing change in nursing practice. While both theories provide frameworks for understanding and managing change, they approach the change process from different perspectives and offer distinct advantages and disadvantages.
Lewin's change theory is based on the concept of unfreezing, moving, and refreezing. Unfreezing involves creating a sense of discomfort or dissatisfaction with the current state, while moving involves implementing the desired change, and refreezing involves solidifying the change as the new norm. This theory focuses on the importance of understanding the current state and utilizing supportive leadership to guide individuals through the change process. One advantage of Lewin's theory is its simplicity, making it easily understandable and applicable to various settings. However, its linear approach might oversimplify the complexity of actual change processes, and it may not adequately address the emotional and psychological aspects experienced by individuals during change.
On the other hand, Roger's five-step theory emphasizes communication and collaboration to facilitate change. The five steps include recognizing and valuing the need for change, assessing the options, choosing a course of action, implementing the change, and evaluating its effectiveness. This theory emphasizes the involvement and engagement of stakeholders throughout the change process, promoting a sense of ownership and commitment. One advantage of Roger's theory is its participatory nature, which enhances the likelihood of successful change adoption. However, this theory may be perceived as time-consuming and may require extensive collaboration and communication, which could pose challenges in busy healthcare settings.
Considering the context of a nursing capstone project, it is crucial to choose an appropriate theory for implementing change. The chosen theory should align with the project's objectives and the specific characteristics of the intended change. In this case, considering the potential challenges and complexity of implementing change in a healthcare setting, Lewin's change theory might be more suitable. Its simplicity and focus on leadership support can help navigate the complexities of the change process. However, it is essential to adapt the theory to ensure the emotional and psychological aspects of change are adequately addressed.
In conclusion, both Lewin's change theory and Roger's five-step theory offer valuable frameworks for implementing change in nursing practice. While Lewin's theory emphasizes leadership and simplicity, Roger's theory stresses collaboration and participatory approaches. The most appropriate theory for a nursing capstone project would be Lewin's change theory due to its relative simplicity and focus on supportive leadership to guide individuals through change. However, it is crucial to adapt the theory to account for the emotional and psychological aspects of change. By doing so, nurses can navigate the complexities of change implementation in the healthcare setting successfully.

"Athens and Sparta were two critical poleis of the Archaic Age of Greece; they were inherently similar but different in many ways. They both shared representative forms of government through assemblies of members elected by the citizens of each respective polis, but Sparta was ruled by two kings in a strictly controlled military state, while Athens was ruled by archons elected annually in a democracy. Both city-states shared an extensive slave-owning culture, with Spartans enslaving the helots while Athens owned significant populations of slaves. It could be argued that both Sparta and Athens were militaristic. Sparta was the epitome of military culture, training males from a young age to fight and be independent. However, Athens also maintained a strong army and powerful navy as well; it was a pacified city-state, often raging war to establish control (Brooks, 2019).
Where the two city-states differed significantly is their cultures. Sparta was a military society focused on service to the military and state. It emphasized aspects such as duty, discipline, and physical endurance through all elements of its government system, such as the military, education, and civil service. In many ways, Athens also valued these aspects, particularly with an emphasis on civil service, especially after reforms that allowed not just wealthy aristocrats to rule but gave all males access to power. However, the Athens culture was also heavily embedded in humanities, such as philosophies, art, and entertainment – things that Sparta had little concern for in its society. Athens also maintained a strong class division, where the ruling elite controlled much of the power and wealth while the lower classes, despite being citizens, were given less. Women who had virtually no power, voice, or presence in Athens society were not allowed to own property or vote and were seen as the property of their husbands and fathers. Meanwhile, while some class division existed in Sparta, the militaristic nature bonded everyone together as both kings and regular Spartans respected each other. Women in Sparta were given the most rights, likely in the whole ancient world, being able to own property, could speak publicly, run households, and be relied upon by their husbands (Brooks, 2019)."
"Plato’s Gorgias is the writing written in the form of dialogues between Socrates and sophists. In these dialogues, philosophers argue and share their views on virtue and rhetoric. According to Gorgias, “A rhetorician is capable of speaking effectively against all comers, whatever the issue, and can consequently be more persuasive in front of crowds about… anything he likes” (Dodds, 1990). Hence, in his view, rhetoric is mainly used for compellingly presenting an argument.
Socrates argues that oratory practices that became popular among sophists in Athens pursue convincing and persuading rather than speaking the truth. “And the same will be true of the orator and the oratory in relation to all other arts. The orator need have no knowledge of the truth about thongs; it is enough for him to have discovered a knack of persuading the ignorant that he seems to know more than the experts.” (Dodds, 1990). He despises such practice because oratory rhetoric can be practiced and mastered. Whether it is true or not, any argument, whether the speaker knows the subject or is ignorant.
Consequently, the example of how rhetoric and oratory skills can be abused to persuade people into doing harmful things is seen in “Thank You for Smoking” book The main protagonist of the book Nick Naylor is a lobbyist for a tobacco company. He is able to win any argument with his wit and his speeches. For example, he made a speech in congress where he started with the statement “show of hands who out there thinks that cigarettes aren’t dangerous?” knowing that the cigarettes are indeed dangerous and that nobody interacts with the audience in Congress (Buckley 2010). He mastered three rhetorical appeals as Ethos that appeals to credibility; Logos appeal to reason, and Pathos appeals to emotions. Therefore, regardless of the truth behind his words, the audience is most likely to be convinced by Naylor’s rhetoric at the end of his speech."
"In today's diverse classrooms, it is crucial for teachers to create an inclusive learning environment that encourages active participation and language use among dual-language learners (DLLs). To effectively support these students, educators must utilize a variety of strategies and provide engaging activities that facilitate language acquisition while also minimizing their own talking time.
One effective way to encourage active participation among DLLs is to incorporate group activities that foster collaboration and peer interaction. For instance, teachers can assign small group projects that require students to work together to solve a problem or complete a task. This not only promotes teamwork but also provides an opportunity for DLLs to practice their language skills in a supportive environment. By assigning roles within the groups, teachers can ensure that each student has a chance to contribute and actively use language.
Furthermore, incorporating visuals and hands-on materials can greatly enhance DLLs' participation and language development. Teachers can create language-rich classroom environments by displaying word walls, anchor charts, and labeled objects. This visual support helps DLLs make connections between words and their meanings, fostering comprehension and oral language production. Additionally, using manipulatives and props during lessons can provide concrete examples that DLLs can interact with, strengthening their understanding and ability to express themselves.
To minimize teacher's talking time while still facilitating oral language development, teachers can implement strategies such as wait time and open-ended questions. By allowing a pause after asking a question, teachers give DLLs a chance to process the question and construct a response. This also encourages students to take risks and participate actively rather than relying on the teacher for answers. Furthermore, using open-ended questions encourages DLLs to provide detailed responses, promoting language use and critical thinking skills. Asking questions like ""What do you think?"" or ""How would you solve this problem?"" allows students to express their thoughts using their developing language skills.
In conclusion, teachers play a vital role in encouraging active participation and language use among DLLs. By incorporating group activities, visual support, wait time, and open-ended questions, educators can create an inclusive classroom environment that fosters oral language development for all students. Implementing these strategies ensures that DLLs have ample opportunities to engage in meaningful language use, promoting both academic success and cultural inclusion."
"The widespread use of electronic nicotine delivery systems, commonly known as e-cigarettes, has gained significant attention in recent years. While these devices were initially marketed as a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes, mounting evidence suggests that they carry harmful effects on the human body. This essay aims to discuss these adverse effects and argue for the regulation and restriction of e-cigarettes to safeguard public health.
To begin, one must acknowledge that e-cigarettes contain harmful chemicals. While they may lack the tobacco found in traditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes still contain nicotine, which is addictive and damages various bodily systems. Nicotine causes an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, putting users at a higher risk of heart diseases. Moreover, frequent exposure to nicotine found in e-cigarettes can lead to addiction, particularly among young individuals who might be more susceptible to its effects.
Furthermore, while the long-term effects of e-cigarette usage require further research, numerous studies have already highlighted the immediate dangers they pose. The process of ""vaping"" involves heating a liquid that often contains volatile organic compounds, heavy metals, and flavoring agents. Inhalation of these substances can cause lung irritation, trigger asthma attacks, and in severe cases, result in lung injury. The outbreak of vaping-related lung illnesses and deaths reported in recent years is a clear testament to the potential harm these devices can inflict.
Another concerning aspect of e-cigarettes is their appeal to youth. The enticing flavors, sleek designs, and targeted marketing strategies have made e-cigarettes increasingly popular among adolescents. Studies have shown that e-cigarette use among teenagers has reached alarming levels, sparking concerns about nicotine addiction and its subsequent effects on brain development. Nicotine exposure during adolescence can disrupt proper brain functioning, impairing cognition, and increasing the risk of mental health disorders.
Given these harmful effects, regulatory measures and restrictions on e-cigarettes are imperative to protect public health. Firstly, stricter marketing regulations should be enforced to prevent the targeting of young individuals. This includes prohibiting the use of appealing flavors and restricting advertisement tactics that glamorize e-cigarettes. Additionally, age restrictions and comprehensive public education campaigns are necessary to discourage youth experimentation and enhance awareness about the risks associated with these devices.
Moreover, proper regulation will ensure that the manufacturing and distribution of e-cigarettes adhere to strict safety standards. Implementing rigorous quality control measures will help reduce the risk of contamination by hazardous chemicals and metals. Additionally, limitations on nicotine content and banning the use of certain additives can reduce the addictive potential and minimize health risks further.
In conclusion, the harmful effects of e-cigarettes on the human body cannot be overlooked. The availability and appeal of these devices, particularly among young individuals, demand urgent regulatory action. By implementing stricter marketing restrictions, age limitations, and safety guidelines, society can protect public health. As we move forward, it is imperative that policy-makers prioritize the regulation and restriction of e-cigarettes to mitigate their detrimental impact on individuals and safeguard the well-being of society as a whole."
"The computation of the three ratios
Return on Assets (RoA)
Return on Equity (RoE)
Profit Margin
The purpose and information conveyed by each ratios
The three ratios presented and computed in the previous section represent vital profit generation indicators for a modern commercial organization. The return on assets (RoA) shows how well the company utilizes the entirety of its assets, including the borrowed ones, to generate financial returns. The return on equity is largely similar to this metric, but it does not consider the debt of the company (Gallo, 2016). Finally, the profit margin is one of the most important indicators of financial health, as it draws a direct comparison between sales and profits, showing how much the company actually earns from its operations.
ABC Company review on three ratios
First of all, the ABC Company’s business model can be deemed successful, as it generates adequate profits. Optimal returns on equity and assets show that the investors can reasonably expect returns on their participation in the company’s financing. The profit margin is also considerable, which means that this aspect of the firm is handled well.
The profitability of the company
Overall, the ABC Company remains a profitable enterprise that successfully converts its assets into revenues. The profit margin is over 50%, which is commendable, even though the overall turnover is below $1 million. Therefore, the business model on its own functions well, allowing the ABC Company to retain a stable position on the market. However, it may not suffice for the sustained growth in the long-term.
ABC Company financial successful
While the ABC Company’s financial statement may present positive indicators, it would be unwise to consider the company in isolation. Instead, it appears to interesting to compare the entity’s performance against the industry’s leaders to identify the areas in which it excels or where the improvements are needed. First of all, the return on assets is provided by Rose (2022), indicating that the industry’s average was set at 9.1-9.3% across the past four years. The ABC Company’s figures are considerably higher at the moment with 28.3%, but it is important to note that its absolute cash flows are not on par with the industry’s leaders. Thus, it is possible that the ABC Company’s ratios will become lower as the entity continues to grow.
This difference becomes particularly evident when the income levels are compared with the industry’s average figures. As far as net income is concerned, the industry has averaged at $4.7 million in 2020. The ABC Company is far from this level, as its net income is only $77,000, which implies that it still has a long growth phase ahead. Furthermore, the industry’s leaders, such as Williams-Sonoma, have hundreds of millions of sales, whereas the ABC Company only has half-a-million. As the total assets of the company increase, there is no guarantee that its profit margins and returns on investment will remain equally high. Under these circumstances, the emphasis will be on maintaining the profitability of operations above the average level across the industry."
"Introduction
From the perspective of business accounting, risk management involves the assessment, evaluation, and mitigation of risk within the practices of an organization. Typically, risk management is seen as a strategic management concept, but within the context of modern businesses, accounting contributes strongly and is heavily invested in risk aversion. Enterprise risk management should be at the core of a professional accounting mindset, and to add value, accountants must be outward-looking risk experts that offer insight for their organizations when meeting their objectives or responding to uncertainty. Finance and accounting provide key quality information to management in a timely manner that can be used by managers at all levels for informed decision-making (Camilleri & Camilleri, 2017). Accounting is a tool for success, working with operating management to make conducive decisions, take on evaluated risks, and achieve enterprise strategic goals.
Definition
Risk management is a comprehensive process of identifying, analyzing, and mitigating/accepting the risk of uncertainty. Risk is quantifiable in both absolute and relative terms and becomes ultimately inseparable from return on investment. Despite risk being viewed in negative terms, it is necessary to achieve performance objectives. In its basic form in accounting, the risk is a deviation from the expected outcome (Camilleri & Camilleri, 2017). The deviation is either positive or negative, but it is generally accepted by financial professionals that increased returns come at greater risk and, in turn, come from increased volatility. Accountants consistently search for means to reduce volatility and risk through the use of various metrics such as standard deviation, distributions, and dispersions. Risk assessment is one of the key components of internal control in organizations, identifying areas of risk loss via accounting records and implementing adequate controls (Needles et al., 2014). Evaluating risk statistically and numerically allows for highly informed decision-making in regard to existing or potential risks.
Risk has traditionally been defined in terms of the chance of danger, loss, injury, or other negative consequences. In accounting, the risk is viewed from the perspective of decision trees, probability distributions, cost-volume-profit analysis, pricing models, cash flow models, and many other frameworks. Risk management allows one to methodically address risk, immediately attaching it to organizational activities and pursuing organizational objectives. Effective risk management consists of assessment, evaluation, treatment, and reporting. Meanwhile, the more in-depth enterprise risk management approach is aimed at aligning risk management with a business strategy and embedding a management culture into business operations (Collier et al., 2006).
Types of Risk
Risk is broken down into categories allowing for more effective and efficient comparison and evaluation. Risk will always be existent to some extent, so accountants must understand that some level of risk is viable, but tradeoffs and opportunity costs must be considered to either eliminate or maintain some risks. Therefore, it may be helpful to categorize risks, but different institutions may approach this differently.
 1. Market risk – changing conditions in the marketplace where the organization operates, ranging from general market tendencies to specific company-specific elements.
 2. Credit risk – stemming from the risk associated with credit extended to customers and/or suppliers, with the risk that either can default. The company must also ensure that it meets its own credit obligations in a timely manner.
 3. Liquidity risk – this can include asset liquidity and operational funding liquidity. The company must have cash on hand to pay for basic expenses, balancing its assets and operational funding.
 4. Operational risk – risk arising from daily business activities, ranging from crises and lawsuits to fraud and business models (Camilleri & Camilleri, 2017).
Role of Accountants
Accountants have an important role in helping organizations with internal controls and risk management processes. It is one of the core competencies of accountancy as a profession to oversee and improve internal control programs in an organization. They ensure that staff members are away of risk control language and standards, which must be met with all financial operations. Accountants virtually create the standards and then implement them in an organization (Needles et al., 2014). In a way, accountants are key strategic partners in decision-making management in risk management and consideration.
Accountants are most effective at risk management when they have an understanding of enterprise risk management (ERM) and applications of daily operations of a business. Companies with ERM strategies in place generally thrive better in risk and can focus on business continuity. A significant portion of companies is reactive to risks rather than proactive, and risk management is an activity that is best undertaken offensively before anyone is prepared. In order to do so competently, companies need accounting staff that can measure and manage risks accurately in all their forms. However, for ERM to work, it must be linked directly to company strategy and actions. Accountants have direct insight into a company’s finances and supply chains, so they work cross-functionally with other departments, such as H.R., I.T., sustainability, and others, to essentially evaluate financial and non-financial risks across the organization to construct a holistic risk framework (Thompson, 2020).
Impact on Accounting Quality
ERM gained significant attention and popularity in the midst of the 2008 crisis. It is believed to enhance a company’s ability to soften the impact of a major economic crisis as well as lead to an improved value relevance of account information for firms adopting ERM. Accounting quality is not a clearly defined term but generally implies that the value relevance of accounting information is considered and the ability of accounting information to reflect the true performance of an organization. Some common characteristics highlighted as vital to accounting quality are timeliness and timely loss recognition, accrual quality, earnings management, and discretionary accruals (Olayinka et al., 2019).
Accounting quality allows firms to reduce earnings management, minimize discretionary accrual, and offer great information on earnings. It is a vital measure of the value relevance of accounting for an organization seeking sustainable growth. ERM became popular around the world because it is meant to enhance the accuracy of corporate disclosure, improve the reliability of financial statements, develop stronger risk management, and enhance accounting quality. Therefore, accounting is directly interrelated with risk management and prevention in such systems. Accounting is vital for ERM function, while ERM seeks to enhance accounting processes by improving financial reporting quality and strengthening the internal processes of an organization (Olayinka et al., 2019).
Risk Management and Corporate Governance
Competent corporate governance is a result of an effective risk management system that creates a controlled environment. This is why much recent legislation around the world, including the Dodd-Frank Act in the U.S. in response to the 2008 financial crisis, requires effective risk management implemented in firms. Management accounting, under the concepts of risk and governance, has to be managerially actionable in order for their role and proficiency to be interpretable in logical and predictable terms. While risk management is the foundation of modern management control, management accounting is directly influencing corporate governance. For example, failure to provide accurate accounting reports and then use these reports inefficiently by risk management will have a negative impact on corporate governance. There is an inherent interdependence between risk management, managerial accounting, and corporate governance (Van der Poll & Mthiyane, 2018).
The design and utilization of strategic management accounting techniques are based on strategic information collection to address environmental uncertainties to support strategic decision-making. As part of the organizational structure, it is the role of the board as part of corporate governance to formulate a successful strategy, with managerial accounting reports enabling this task. Strategic management accounting is the basis for strategic positioning, which includes Porter’s competitive advantage and strategic cost exploration. Therefore, the usefulness of management accounts in risk management is paramount and is necessary for sustainability. However, if a firm chooses to ignore the strategic position, management accounting can then be used as a mitigation strategy. This once again demonstrates the triangle, side-by-side interdependence between corporate governance, risk management, and management accounting, and companies should recognize this interdependence (Van der Poll & Mthiyane, 2018).
Therefore, to understand how accounting systems influence risk management, it is important to view the firm as a governance coordinating mechanism for information provided to individuals. The objective is that the correct information is shared with targeted teams, departments, and individuals to whom they are relevant and enable them to undertake the tasks which fall under their responsibility. Effective information provision seeks to support efficient operations and primary concerns regarding risk management. Another important step is to extract meaning from the information, which requires expert judgment to interpret various calculative practices for risk assessment, such as the interpretation of uncertainty (Brookfield, 2018). Management accounting is a critical aspect of a company. However, even its elements can have certain challenges. For example, transparency, which is exalted as necessary for smooth governance, can be concerning. Evidence has shown that not all firms utilize management accounting in risk management for governance purposes. Some viewed M.A. statements but chose to ignore them; others presented manipulated healthy financial information, which was inaccurate, leading to collapse in both cases (Van der Poll & Mthiyane, 2018).
Multiple organizations adopt ERM to meet compliance regulations and virtually ignore the need to proceed with risks strategically. However, a comprehensive ERM approach is more effective. First, management accountants are asked to aid the organization in identifying risks and opportunities with events that have not yet occurred. Accounting is also asked to determine probabilities of occurrence and financial outcomes of these events, as well as justify why substantial investment controls of said risks are necessary even though there are chances they will never happen. Management accountants are familiar with regulatory standards, have direct lines to top executives, and usually have the experience for informed advising to decision-making parties. Management accountants play internal control roles in various ERM activities, and these activities may be aimed at multiple stages of risk management, from risk prevention itself, such as staff training, information on new software, etc., to actually resolving problems when confronted with consumers or regulators (analyzing costs of alternative ways of delivering repairs). Despite this, the profession still has no clear taxonomy regarding the role of management accountants in ERM activities (Bento et al., 2018).
While research and regulatory body of guidance and frameworks in ERM are becoming extensive, management accountants are still creating new territory regarding ERM practices. Management accountants have specialized experience and training on how to measure, report and analyze the financial and non-financial impact of decisions. Given leadership roles, management accountants can develop truly enterprise-focused ERM systems that are not dependent on functional silos but seek to permeate decision-making through the organization. This fits into the new paradigm of management accounting which calls to broaden its professional strategic scope and be better than a myopic view of planning and control, measuring the performance of the past and being able to make forward-predictive measurements about organizational sustainability and risk (Bento et al., 2018).
In a complex dynamic market environment, the effectiveness of risk mitigation may be difficult to pinpoint. The point of ERM is not to maximize profits but rather to create an equilibrium that is optimal and conditioned on its environment. The organization reaches a status quo where desired outcomes are reproduced from transactions undertaken that motivated the firm creation in the first place. Therefore, the issue adjusts from a static set of accounting-based budget targets to a process of equilibrium. Accounting and accounting technologies contribute immensely to organizational effectiveness and follow all other elements of organizational hierarchy closely (Brookfield, 2018). The key to remember is that information provision is always central to accounting technology and its role in effective risk mitigation.
Future of Risk Management
Currently, the financial industry is undergoing significant changes with the advent of blockchain and fintech technology. Blockchain is a disruptive element in currency, supply chains, and information-sharing practices. However, as with any new technology and practices, it will present additional risks. Accounting and ERM will be at the helm by addressing aspects of financial data integrity issues, financial reporting risks, and implications for external auditors. Firms that adopt blockchain will have to adjust their policies and accounting practices over internal controls and counterparty risk assessment. Both internal and external auditors will have to assess blockchain implementation primarily as a financial reporting risk (Smith & Castonguay, 2019).
Advancements in fintech are rapidly advancing, with up to a quarter of global financial institutions being at risk in the near future. The primary benefit of financial tech is eliminating elements of costly data entry and analysis. However, fintech has built-in logic and compliance with business models being built around data flow, greatly increasing transparency and reducing the time necessary to prepare for an audit example. As a result, accounting practices will shift dramatically as A.I. will be able to fulfill many manual human jobs currently ranging from data entry to selecting the right statistical sample in an audit. On the one hand, it will free up the human potential to focus on big data analysis and actually work with clients to improve business operations. On the other, it signifies an era of rapid change for accounting with changing standards, new issues, and most likely significantly new risks that the industry has not faced beforehand.
Biblical Worldview
Although a significant portion of the Bible concerns itself with faith and trust in the Lord, there are also calls to be prepared, to plan ahead, and to be rational with finances. In Luke 14:25-33, Jesus encourages followers to consider what it takes to follow him. Planning ahead is an important part of committing to any given thing. Jesus illustrates this through a short example, “For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not sit down first and count the cost, whether he has enough to finish – lest, after he has laid the foundation, and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him saying, ‘This man began to build and was not able to finish’” (New International Version, 2011, Luke 14:28-30).
Making a blunt comparison in accounting, this would represent an imbalance between accounts payable and accounts receivable or a new project running out of funding prior to completion. These are risks that accountants consider and calculate in the long term prior to the project being financed even. They account for various risks such as increased costs with time, disrupted supply chains, passed deadlines, accrued costs, and others. As a result, management can make informed decisions based on this, to either postpone building ‘the tower’ or divert resources from other projects or find additional financing. The Christian worldview encourages us to have faith but also be prepared, approaching everything with preparation and responsibility. Risk management and planning for its mitigation are some of the critical elements from an accounting perspective.
Conclusion
Risk management is a key element of accounting, collaborating with organizational management to identify, evaluate, and mitigate deviations from the planned course of actions and finances. Deeply ingrained in enterprise risk management, accounting offers unique insights into organizational status, performance, and sustainability with up-to-date information provided to executives. This paper demonstrates the importance for organizations to invest in reactive risk management systems and accounting foundations in order to navigate and mitigate risks safely and effectively as part of competent governance and corporate sustainability."
"Conflict management at the workplace is one of the crucial elements related to the organization of work in healthcare facilities. In this regard, McKibben (2017) asserts that conflict is an inevitable part of any human interaction, especially when the collective activity is associated with physical, mental, and ethical complexity found in hospitals. Consequently, if ignored or not handled adequately, the disputes between the colleges at the workplace lead to decreased performance and satisfaction levels of the involved employees (Suifan, Alhyari, & Sweis, 2020). This, in turn, negatively impacts the overall quality of provided patient care. Therefore, it is important to resolve the conflicts as soon as they appear. However, to understand how to manage disputes effectively, one should understand the factors that cause them.
In general, all the antecedents of organizational conflicts may be divided into three groups, namely individual, interpersonal, and organizational. As for the former, Kim et al. (2017) argue that the healthcare professional’s self-esteem, self-focus, emotional intelligence, prevalent responses to conflict, communication styles, and overall worldview determine the frequency and severity of the disputes. In a similar vein, Chang, Chen, and Chen (2017) found that a person’s license level, age, and previous experience of working in other collectives can all affect the behavior during conflict situations. Interpersonal conflicts, on the contrary, are caused by such factors as lack of trust and respect towards a person, power abuse, and ineffective communication (Kim et al., 2017). Finally, organizational conflicts stem from the overall structure and work arrangement. In this respect, such factors as ambiguously defined responsibilities and inadequate hierarchy can cause dissatisfaction and disputes (Kim et al., 2017; McKibben, 2017). Therefore, this type of conflict appears as a result of weak or wrongful management decisions.
I have also participated in several conflicts that can be explained by the factors mentioned above. Firstly, I have a friend who is generally a good person but who is quite self-focused; thus, he often fails to recognize other people’s opinions. Due to that, we usually have to do what he wants, which eventually leads to conflict when I become tired of compromising. Secondly, I have noticed that many conflicts between me and my parents and friends are caused by my inability to control one’s emotions. Finally, once, we had a conflict with my classmates while working on the team project as we failed to discuss the responsibilities of each person before starting."
"Overpopulation is a concerning factor considering it has led to adverse environmental and societal effects. The consequences of overpopulation include the depletion of natural resources and climate change which have hindered the conservation of natural resources such as water and animals (Weber & Sciubba, 2019). Therefore, there is an urgent need to control overpopulation considering the fact that it will lead to the planet’s conservation (Weber & Sciubba, 2019). Therefore, everyone is obligated to control human population growth since it has steered increased extraction of resources from the environment, such as overfishing, contamination of water, and soil degradation, leading to depletion.
Water has become a scarce commodity due to activities such as the over-pumping of groundwater. People consume large amounts of water as their population increases, leading to its depletion. Other activities, such as water contamination through industrial wastes and marine dumping, have reduced water levels (Weber & Sciubba, 2019). Another situation caused by the growing population is the depletion of natural resources such as fish due to the increasing demand for these aquatic animals (Weber & Sciubba, 2019). When the demand increases, activities such as overfishing become normalized, resulting in extinction.
Soil degradation is another regressive indicator that signifies the change in the ecosystem. Activities that promote soil erosion include the over-cultivation of land for commercial agriculture to sustain the growing population and the overgrazing of animals (Weber & Sciubba, 2019). These activities lead to the reduction of soil quality, which has promoted the loss of biodiversity. All the activities mentioned have resulted from the pressure to sustain the demands of the growing population (Weber & Sciubba, 2019). Everyone is responsible for stopping this menace, considering that human activities destroy the ecosystem. Reducing the population can be promoted by advocating for family planning programs and adopting new conservation alternatives such as not dumping in the oceans."
"End-Stage Renal Failure (ESRF), also known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD), is a condition characterized by the complete or nearly complete failure of kidney function. This debilitating disease has significant causes, prevalence, and impacts on the population's health, particularly on the urinary system and other vital body systems. Understanding the prefixes, suffixes, and combining forms associated with this condition is essential for comprehending its nature.
ESRF has multiple causes, including diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure (hypertension), glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease, and urinary tract obstructions. Among these, diabetes and hypertension are the leading causes of renal failure, accounting for approximately 75% of ESRF cases worldwide. Diabetes damages the blood vessels in the kidneys over time, impairing their filtration function. Likewise, hypertension puts strain on the blood vessels, leading to reduced blood flow to the kidneys and ultimately causing renal failure. Other conditions, such as glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the kidney's filtering units), polycystic kidney disease (formation of cysts within the kidneys), and urinary tract obstructions (blockages preventing urine flow) can also result in ESRF.
The prevalence of ESRF is alarmingly high, and its impact on the population's health cannot be overstated. It is estimated that over 850 million people worldwide suffer from some form of kidney disease, with ESRF being the most severe manifestation. In the United States alone, more than 700,000 individuals have ESRF, and this number is projected to increase in the coming years due to the aging population and the rising incidence of diabetes and hypertension. The impact of ESRF on the affected individuals and society is significant, with profound physical, emotional, and economic consequences.
The urinary system is particularly affected by ESRF. The kidneys, responsible for filtering waste and excess fluid from the blood, become unable to perform their function adequately. Consequently, waste products and fluid accumulate in the body, leading to complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and acid-base disturbances. Patients with ESRF often experience symptoms such as fluid retention, swelling in the lower extremities, decreased urine output, fatigue, shortness of breath, and altered mental status. Moreover, the condition can progress to the point where kidney transplant or dialysis, a process of filtering waste through a machine, becomes necessary for survival.
ESRF also has a profound impact on other body systems. The cardiovascular system is greatly affected due to the link between ESRF and hypertension. High blood pressure strains the heart and blood vessels, increasing the risk of heart disease, heart attacks, and stroke. Anemia commonly occurs in ESRF patients due to reduced production of erythropoietin, a hormone normally released by the kidneys that stimulates red blood cell production. As a result, patients may experience fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. ESRF can also affect the skeletal system, leading to bone disorders such as renal osteodystrophy, a condition characterized by weakened bones, fractures, and soft tissue calcification.
To better understand the nature of ESRF, it is important to analyze the prefixes, suffixes, and combining forms associated with this condition. The prefix ""end-"" refers to a state of completion or the final stage, emphasizing the severity of the renal failure. The suffix ""-ic"" denotes a condition or state, as in ""renal"" (related to the kidneys). The combining form ""nephr-"" is derived from the Greek word for kidney, while ""uro-"" relates to urine or the urinary system. These linguistic components help us comprehend the essence of ESRF – a renal condition that affects the urinary system profoundly, leading to end-stage renal failure.
In conclusion, ESRF is a significant health issue with various causes, high prevalence, and noticeable impacts on the population's health. This condition detrimentally affects the urinary system, leading to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and acid-base disturbances. Additionally, ESRF has adverse effects on other body systems, including the cardiovascular and skeletal systems. By understanding the different prefixes, suffixes, and combining forms associated with ESRF, one can gain insight into the nature and severity of this debilitating condition. It is imperative that efforts be made to raise awareness, engage in preventive measures, and improve access to treatment to mitigate the burden imposed by ESRF on individuals and society as a whole."

"Pesticide utilization has become extensively prevalent in modern agricultural practices, primarily aimed at boosting crop productivity and protecting plants from pests. However, this widespread reliance on pesticides has raised concerns about its potential consequences on nature and the environment. While pesticides have undoubtedly provided short-term benefits, their long-term impacts can be detrimental. To address this problem and promote sustainable pest management, certain steps need to be taken.
Firstly, pesticide utilization can have severe consequences on biodiversity and ecosystem health. Pesticides are not selective in their targets, leading to the unintentional killing of beneficial insects, such as bees and ladybugs, which play crucial roles in pollination and maintaining ecological balance. Additionally, pesticide residues can accumulate in soil and water bodies, leading to contamination and harmful effects on aquatic life. Furthermore, pesticide exposure can have indirect effects on larger ecosystems, disrupting food chains and endangering vulnerable species.
To mitigate these potential consequences, measures should be implemented to reduce pesticide usage. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) techniques can be employed, which involve the holistic management of pests by integrating various methods such as biological control, crop rotation, and the use of resistant crop varieties. IPM promotes an ecosystem-based approach, aiming to minimize pesticide usage while maximizing crop protection.
Furthermore, education and awareness programs can play a vital role in addressing the issue. Farmers should be educated about the potential risks associated with pesticide utilization and trained in alternative pest management strategies. Government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and academic institutions should collaborate to provide resources, training, and information on sustainable agricultural practices.
Regulatory frameworks should also be strengthened to ensure the responsible use of pesticides. Strict monitoring of pesticide production, distribution, and usage is essential to prevent excessive application and minimize the risks of environmental contamination. Labeling requirements should be clear, providing comprehensive guidance on appropriate dosage, application methods, and safety precautions.
In conclusion, the potential consequences of pesticide utilization on nature and the environment are numerous and alarming. However, implementing sustainable pest management practices can mitigate these risks. By employing integrated pest management, raising awareness, and strengthening regulatory frameworks, we can promote sustainable agriculture and safeguard the delicate balance of our ecosystems for future generations."
"Microsoft Power BI is widely regarded as one of the leading data visualization tools in the market today. Its strengths lie in its customizable dashboards, real-time data updates, and its ability to handle complex table connections with ease. However, there are also weaknesses that need to be considered. In this essay, we will delve into the main strengths and weaknesses of Power BI as a data visualization tool, as well as explore its five most interesting features.
One of the main strengths of Power BI is its customizable dashboards. Users can easily create personalized dashboards that suit their specific needs and preferences. Lyon (168) highlights the user-defined parameters that allow users to retrieve and analyze data without the need for complex coding or querying skills. This flexibility means that users can display the exact information they need, in the format they desire, resulting in a better understanding of the data presented.
Another strength of Power BI is its real-time data updates capability. Power BI can connect to different data sources and automatically update the dashboards and reports in real-time. This feature is particularly useful for organizations that rely on up-to-date information, such as sales and marketing teams.

"There is no simple answer to what it means to be human. Some might say that being human means being independent and controlling their personal lives. For other people, being human means utilizing the refinements of civilization, wearing clothes, and going to work every day, i.e., doing everything that animals cannot do. It is also complicated to say how people want to live because everyone has unique requirements, dreams, and thoughts on this issue. This essay reflects on the On Being podcast and answers the above questions.
In the podcast, Thich Nhat Hanh explains why people need to be human. According to him, “we have to remain human to be able to understand and to be compassionate” (Onbeing.org 30:53 – 30:58). The monk adds that being human means having a right to make mistakes, but the absence of a “right to continue making mistakes” (Onbeing.org 31:15 – 31:20). Therefore, being human means being mindful, responsible, and open-hearted. In other words, being human is about being humane. People live in a world of violence and terror and cannot even talk to each other effectively (Onbeing.org). Consequently, they fail to understand which way of living is genuine. From the words of Thich Nhat Hanh, it could be inferred that people want to live without anger; they want to live mindfully and be in control of their emotions. Nonetheless, an average modern person could hardly achieve this way of living.
Overall, the podcast is immensely inspiring since it is dedicated to being human, problems people face in the modern mad world, and ways to avoid them. The Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh creates an impression of a conscious person whose ideas should be taken seriously. Even though I do not share the Buddhist worldview, I deeply admire the personality of Thich Nhat Hanh since he inspired me to learn more about mindfulness practices."

This essay aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the outbreak, including a discussion on the potential agent causing Anthrax, an overview of the condition, and the current state of the situation in the United States. Furthermore, this essay will explore the relevance of the epidemiologic triangle in understanding the spread of the disease and its implications for public health.
Potential Agent Responsible for Anthrax Outbreak (250 words)
Anthrax is a severe infectious disease caused by the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis. This bacterium has certain characteristics that make it a potential agent responsible for the outbreak. Bacillus anthracis spores can remain viable in the environment for prolonged periods, allowing for the possibility of direct contact with infected animals or animal products, such as contaminated hides, wool, or meat. Moreover, human infection can also result from intentional release, which raises serious concerns about bioterrorism.
Overview of Anthrax and its Impact (300 words)
Anthrax primarily affects animals, particularly herbivores, but can also infect humans through various routes of exposure. There are three main forms of anthrax infection in humans: cutaneous, inhalational, and gastrointestinal. Cutaneous anthrax, the most common form, is characterized by skin lesions that progress to eschar formations. Inhalational anthrax is the most deadly and occurs when individuals inhale spores, leading to severe respiratory distress. Lastly, gastrointestinal anthrax results from ingesting contaminated meat and leads to gastrointestinal symptoms.
The economic impact of the disease is significant, especially for the agricultural sector. Outbreaks among livestock can result in mass deaths, economic losses, and trade restrictions. Furthermore, the psychological impact of a potential bioterrorism attack involving Anthrax causes fear and panic within affected communities and the general public.

"The TED Talks are illustrations of bio-psycho-social-spiritual developmental issues which ultimately create circumstances in which certain people do not feel fully included in society. For example, Smith (2015) refers to the differences correlating with raising a white and a black child. Abdel-Magied (2014), on the other hand, exemplifies how a piece of clothing changes the way people treat, view, and evaluate Muslim women. It is certain that discrimination starts with bias, which is a layered concept. An article published by New York Times (2016) refers to the experiences of non-white people in the US, which often correlate with the lack of feeling of inclusion.
This is also perpetrated by bias, which creates specific overviews in which people tend to favor a group of people over another one. The bias may be automatic, ambiguous, and ambivalent depending on its characteristics and how it manifests in terms of people’s opinions on certain groups of individuals (Fiske, 2022). While such incidents have never been personally experienced, it is certain that the lives of people I know have been affected in terms of self-esteem and confidence, which can often be negatively impacted because of discrimination. I would like to explore racial bias due to its relevance in today’s day and age, namely how it manifests on structural levels."
"Introduction:
In a democratic society, economic equality plays a crucial role in promoting democratic principles and ensuring social justice. The concepts of income and wealth are key components of economic equality, and their relationship to democracy is a complex and multifaceted one. This essay aims to explore the dynamics between income and wealth, examine the significance of each concept in defining economic equality, and discuss how they contribute to the promotion of democratic principles within a community.
Body:
1. The Relationship between Income and Wealth:
Income refers to the flow of money received by an individual or household over a given period, typically through salaries, wages, or business profits. Wealth, on the other hand, consists of accumulated assets such as savings, investments, property, and possessions. While income reflects an individual's earnings, wealth encompasses a person's total net worth. Understanding the distinction between these two concepts is vital in analyzing their significance to economic equality and democracy.
2. Defining Economic Equality:
To determine how economic equality should be defined, it is necessary to consider its impact on democratic principles. Equality of income focuses on narrowing the gap between high and low incomes, ensuring fair wages, and promoting social mobility. This approach emphasizes equal opportunities for all individuals to contribute to society and benefit from its advancements. Conversely, equality of wealth aims to address wealth disparities, providing both a safety net for vulnerable populations and opportunities for wealth accumulation that enable economic empowerment.
3. Contribution to Democratic Principles:
a) Income:
Equal income distribution facilitates an inclusive society by mitigating economic disparities and reducing the likelihood of extreme poverty. It strengthens social cohesion, ensuring a fair and level playing field for individuals to exercise their political rights and participate in democratic processes. By providing economic stability and reducing inequalities, equal income distribution promotes equal opportunities for education, healthcare, and social mobility, thus enhancing the democratic fabric of a community.
b) Wealth:
Equal wealth distribution complements income equality by reducing the concentration of economic power within society. Wealth equality affords individuals autonomy, enabling them to pursue their aspirations and participate actively in decision-making processes. Moreover, the equitable distribution of wealth can prevent the creation of an entrenched elite, fostering a more inclusive democracy where marginalized voices are heard.
4. Striking the Balance:
While both income and wealth are vital aspects of economic equality, striking a balance between the two concepts is essential. Exclusively advocating for income equality might neglect wealth disparities, leading to limited long-term economic security. Conversely, focusing solely on wealth redistribution may disregard the immediate needs of those with low incomes. Effectively managing the relationship between income and wealth is crucial for achieving a harmonious society with equal democratic participation.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, income and wealth are intertwined aspects of economic equality that contribute to the promotion of democratic principles within a community. Equal income distribution ensures social stability, advancements in education, and access to healthcare, fostering inclusivity and equal opportunity. Simultaneously, a fair distribution of wealth empowers individuals by preventing the concentration of economic power and promoting social mobility. Striking a balance between income and wealth is necessary to maximize the benefits of economic equality and promote a thriving democratic society."
"In the grand scheme of things, prosecutors and victims of violent crimes are natural allies. The prosecutors strive to bring the offenders to justice, whether to fulfill their duty before the law or achieve career progress. At the same time, the victims get moral satisfaction when the criminals are brought to justice. Therefore, one might think that prosecutors and victims are naturally supposed to cooperate. However, this logical scenario does not necessarily happen in practice. Sometimes, the victims cannot adequately cooperate with the prosecutors due to the experienced shock, fear, or mistreatment in the prosecutor’s office. During the mid-70s, the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration funded the first Victim/Witness Assistance Projects (VWAPs) in order to enhance cooperation between the prosecutors’ offices and victims (Karmen, 2019). With time, the VWAPs have become firmly established institutions charged with the noble mission of supporting crime victims.
Prosecutor offices can assist the victims of violent crimes through various means. The best practices include psychological help in hotlines and crisis counseling, shelter, food, transportation, and property recovery (Karmen, 2019). In addition, most VWAPs make referrals to local agencies, which provide the victims with long-term care (Karmen, 2019). Furthermore, prosecutor offices offer legal assistance through pamphlets about the adjudication process. Finally, VWAPs mitigate confusion by notifying the victims about indictments, postponements, acquittals, convictions, and other possible developments in the case (Karmen, 2019). As such, the modern prosecutor offices are well equipped for ensuring the victims’ cooperation through legal, psychological, and even financial support.
The San Diego County District Attorney’s Office serves as a specific example of a well-rounded victim services project. The Victim Assistance Program offers emergency (crisis intervention), legal (court support, orientation in the criminal justice system), and psychological (referral assistance) help (San Diego County District Attorney, n.d.). In addition, victims of violent crimes may receive special reimbursement for eligible losses from the Victim Compensation Board, which is funded by restitution fines (San Diego County District Attorney, n.d.). These reimbursements cover such losses as medical expenses, home security improvements, or outpatient mental treatment, among others. Overall, crime victims in the County of San Diego can rely on decent support from their District Attorney’s office."
"Achieving core and specialty competencies is of significance for DNP learners since it ensures that they gain knowledge and skills that are essential for their future professional activity. That is why it is reasonable to involve in evaluating whether the scientific activity and practice immersion hours contribute to reaching this result. Thus, the given paper will comment on how I have achieved five course outcomes and present my self-reflection regarding the work made.
Nursing and science-based theories play a significant role in my professional area. That is why I invested many efforts to ensure that I used and integrated them during my coursework. For example, these approaches helped me identify that creating interdisciplinary research and practice themes is a valuable activity. The rationale behind this claim refers to the fact that multiple course assignments revealed the significance of collaboration. In particular, I found that there should be a direct connection between researchers and decision-makers because scholarly evidence should guide healthcare delivery models to address many issues, and pressure injuries are among them.
Furthermore, working with my DPI project demonstrates that theories are of significance when it comes to addressing specific health problems. That is why the theory of planned behavior is considered a practical approach to minimize the prevalence of pressure injuries in the health care industry. On the one hand, scientific evidence offers some arguments in favor of the given idea. On the other hand, practice immersion hours demonstrated that the theory of planned behavior is an effective tool. The rationale behind this claim relates to the fact that patients’ health tends to improve when they are told what and when to do. That is why the given theory is an adequate theoretical base to combat pressure injuries.
It is also worth admitting that the employment of science-based theories and concepts was an effective approach to enhance health care delivery. In particular, it relates to the fact that numerous factors, including injuries, infections, and others, can affect patient safety. That is why it was found that beneficial outcomes can be obtained from using “a customized set of Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) patient fall reduction guidelines” (William, 2020, p. 210). This information reveals that the literature review activities have led to implementing new practice approaches that have the potential to follow high healthcare delivery standards.
Simultaneously, achieving the course competencies has provided me with solid theoretical information on my DPI Project. It relates to the fact that I enriched my knowledge of epidemiology, research practice, and statistical methods regarding pressure injuries. I have managed to absorb this information by investing in literature review activities. The rationale behind this strategy refers to the fact that scholarly sources can provide all the required information concerning a specific health issue and its place in the medical industry.
Finally, it is reasonable to comment on how I will apply the information above to my DPI Project. On the one hand, I will use the theory of planned behavior as a basis of the practice improvement interventions. This approach is considered adequate because credible data have revealed that patients need specific recommendations and directions that will guide their behavior and help them achieve better health outcomes. On the other hand, the course activities have helped me understand that the application of science-based theories is possible if it is supported by sufficient evidence. That is why I will do my best to enrich the DPI Project with credible, relevant, and timely literature findings.
Since DNPs should do their best to promote the principles of business, finance, and economics, I also invested in this sphere. I developed a budget for my DPI Project and provided the rationale for it. It refers to course DNP-840 that included comments on direct and indirect, fixed and variable, as well as other costs to reduce the prevalence of pressure injuries among older people in a medical unit. That activity resulted in the fact that I now understand that a DNP should invest sufficient time and effort in ensuring that medical interventions should stay within stipulated budgets (Nolin, 2017). This competency will inevitably bring a few advantages to my professional practice.
Furthermore, the course assignments helped me develop and improve my leadership, influence, and advocacy skills in implementing healthcare policies. In particular, it relates to a case study analysis that I performed. The assignment focuses on breast cancer since it is a widespread condition affecting multiple patients. I identified that this health problem implies ethical and cultural implications of care because a specific population, older women, are more subject to the condition. That is why the course assignments allowed me to make sure that early screening is an essential approach to minimize the prevalence of breast cancer.
In the healthcare industry, one should draw sufficient attention to employing consultative and leadership skills. I invested in developing this competency during my practice immersion hours. It refers to the fact that I worked in collaboration with professionals from dietary, respiratory, and physician groups. In that case, it was required to rely on effective leadership practices to promote the work of such professionally diverse groups. That is why I applied concepts of a few leadership styles, including servant, transformation, and authoritative ones, to motivate and guide these professionals. There is no doubt that effective leadership is of significance when it comes to teamwork in the healthcare sphere.
In addition to that, course 815 was productive because it revealed that my professional practice should aim at meeting health policy standards. This claim relates to the fact that policy governs all life spheres, and the healthcare industry is not an exception. That is why I learned how to find political standards and contribute to their implementation. Furthermore, the course activities allowed me to identify that a few ethical issues related to hospital-acquired pressure ulcers. Thus, I comprehended that my task would be to ensure that patients would not suffer from these problems.
This paragraph will explain how I will use the competencies of this outcome in my DPI Project. Firstly, the principles of finance, business, and economics are essential for the Project because it is necessary to understand whether the proposed interventions will be reasonable from a financial point of view. An attentively developed budget can demonstrate whether it is rational to implement a particular intervention. Secondly, leadership-related competencies are also essential since the DPI Project implies cooperation with many patients, healthcare professionals, and authorities. That is why developed leadership skills will help me motivate and organize individuals to ensure that they approve the Project and actively participate in it.
The work with practice information systems and databases is of significance for DNP nurses. That is why I invested sufficient effort to gain the given competency. It refers to the fact that I completed the assignment from course DNP-815 about the conceptual-theoretical-empirical (CTE) structure. The phenomenon under consideration offers theoretical background for developing a middle-range theory (Garvey et al., 2019). The assignment focused on a theory of nursing in hypertension care. That activity allowed me to understand that the structure could be considered a practical approach to evaluate a middle-range approach and identify its strengths and weaknesses. The literature review played an essential role in my gaining this competency because scholarly evidence was necessary to locate the theory and apply the CTE structure to its analysis.
Furthermore, I dealt with the evaluation of consumer health information sources. I drew specific attention to ensure that they meet the requirements regarding timeliness, accuracy, and appropriateness. This competency was achieved since I relied on financial data and various technical tools to calculate the costs of healthcare and proposed interventions. In this case, the literature review also contributed to essential advantages. It refers to the fact that reliable and timely studies can be a valuable source of information to find and evaluate the required data. Furthermore, analyzing the scientific evidence helped me improve my knowledge of healthcare-related practices and tools.
Simultaneously, I reviewed and evaluated Internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (iCBT). This approach was practical since it helped select and use health information systems and patient care technology. In particular, this competency refers to an assignment on technology interface evaluation. That activity allowed me to become familiar with such concepts as usability, functionality, and user experience. I identified that all information systems should meet multiple requirements to ensure that both patients and healthcare professionals can benefit from them.
In addition to that, DNP-835 was productive for me since I completed a case report for the application of quality and safety concepts. It refers to the fact that I identified that a few measures could directly influence patient safety. According to Ismail (2017), they are “state policy, diagnosis, medications, surgical operations, infections, and injuries” (p. 592). It denotes that any of these spheres can create barriers and threats to the concept of patient safety within a healthcare setting. Simultaneously, it indicates that it is possible to affect any of the areas to provide patients with safer and more qualitative care.
Finally, it is rational to state what information will be used in my DPI Project. Firstly, the information regarding a middle-range theory and its advantages and disadvantages can be of significance to guide my intervention. Secondly, I will use the skills in calculating the budgets of healthcare and proposed interventions to ensure that my Project will not be a significant financial burden for an organization. Thirdly, I will do my best to make the intervention meet the usability, functionality, and user experience requirements. Fourthly, an insight into the patient safety areas above will lead to the fact that my intervention will provide individuals with adequate care, at least within one of these spheres.
The first segment of this outcome relates to analyzing epidemiological, biostatistical, environmental, and other appropriate scientific data regarding multiple case issues. The epidemiology paper from DNP-825 has helped me meet this objective. It occurred because the case with breast cancer was used to identify the concepts above. Thus, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (2020) demonstrates that “early menstrual periods before age 12 and starting menopause after age 55 expose women to hormones longer” (para. 5). This finding explains what factors and why they contribute to the fact that breast cancer is considered a widespread disease among women worldwide.
It is worth admitting that the literature review activity played an essential role in mastering this outcome. The rationale behind this claim refers to the fact that working with scientific data is a productive strategy to find the required information. The same epidemiology paper involved working with multiple scientific and governmental sources to identify epidemiological, biostatistical, environmental, and other data. I drew sufficient attention to ensure that I worked with credible and reliable articles and studies. That activity allowed me to understand how to dissect a research article and find the data that were relevant to my research.
Simultaneously, I actively engaged in advocating for social justice, equity, and ethical policies within all healthcare spheres. This claim refers to the fact that I participated in five scholarly activities to identify how COVID-19 affects healthcare staff’s needs. In particular, I focused on the necessity to standardize the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) since this strategy could directly affect medical professionals’ response to the pandemic. Those assignments helped me understand that medical facilities should offer sufficient safety conditions to all healthcare providers and patients irrespective of their race, ethnicity, gender, socio-economic status, and others. This approach can ensure that social justice and equity are promoted in the medical industry.
In addition to that, the scholarly activities above demonstrated that specific equipment could be considered an effective tool to achieve better health outcomes. That is why the conducted research allowed me to discover that appropriate equipment pieces can reduce the prevalence of pressure injuries among hospitalized patients. Since I have arrived at such a viewpoint, it was necessary to check whether it was valid. Thus, I conducted a literature search to locate timely and empirical studies that would either support or deny the advantages of relying on equipment to combat pressure ulcers.
There is no doubt that I will effectively apply the skills and knowledge above to my DPI Project. The competency in identifying epidemiological data is essential since it helps identify a widespread health issue and at-risk population to consider in the Project. Since I understand the necessity to promote social justice and equality in healthcare delivery, I will ensure that my proposed interventions will not discriminate against any group of people based on their characteristic features. Furthermore, my DPI Project will try to focus on using specific equipment to reduce pressure injuries because sufficient evidence reveals the benefits of using this method.
The DPI draft prospectus contributed to evaluating outcomes of practice, practice patterns, and systems of care for public health. This claim relates to the fact that this activity helped me advance theory by highlighting whether it was possible to reduce the prevalence of pressure ulcers in the healthcare industry. This outcome was achieved because I focused on the existing national benchmarks regarding the health issue under analysis. Thus, the given approach demonstrated that pressure injuries were a significant problem for the whole medical industry. That is why it is necessary to develop specific interventions to address the situation at a local level.
Furthermore, many activities have contributed to the fact that I became familiar with improvement methodologies to promote safe, patient-centered, and timely care. Firstly, I engaged in multiple peer discussions on patient-centered approaches to care delivery. Those activities were productive since I expressed my own thoughts about the topic and listened to my peers’ opinions. The interaction of this kind helped me gain sufficient knowledge on the subject to evaluate the existing approaches and choose the most optimal one. Furthermore, I discovered that there should be a solid partnership between a patient and a clinician. In this case, the probability of achieving the desired health outcomes increases because all stakeholders actively participate in the process.
Secondly, it is necessary to admit that my DPI Project can be considered a quality improvement program. The reasoning behind this claim is that it promotes a prevention program to drive good outcomes. Simultaneously, a specific methodology can provide patients with multiple advantages if it is used correctly and safely. The literature research activities help me identify the existing methodologies, compare them, and choose the most suitable one. There is no doubt that this approach ensures that I provide patient-centered care and lead to achieving improved health outcomes.
Thirdly, it is impossible to ignore the three-part assignment on quality and sustainability from DNP-835. That assignment allowed me to understand that there is a solid connection between a safety theory and health issues. In particular, it was identified that “Watson’s Human Caring Theory is widely used to guide nursing education, practice, and research internationally” (Wei & Watson, 2019, p. 17). Since I discovered that patient falls occur because patients are not provided with sufficient safety, the identified theory demonstrates that this situation can be addressed by improving nursing education and practice. It means that healthcare professionals are primarily responsible for achieving the best health outcomes.
In conclusion, I can firmly admit that the competencies of this outcome will be beneficial for my DPI Project. National benchmarks in the sphere of healthcare quality can be a clear goal that my activity will try to achieve. The acquaintance with multiple improvement methodologies will ensure that my Project will use the most effective option. Finally, the quality and sustainability assignment allowed me to understand that every practical intervention should have a theoretical basis that supports it. Thus, my DPI Project will also focus on a robust theoretical background to achieve successful results.
The given assessment paper has demonstrated that I managed to gain many skills and competencies that can help me complete my DPI Project. Firstly, sufficient expertise in literature review activities denotes that I will work to identify credible and timely sources for the Project. Secondly, the acquaintance with the quality and safety concepts will contribute to the fact that I will develop and implement an intervention that will meet these requirements. Thirdly, the experience in dealing with financial issues will also be utilized in the DPI Project. Finally, leadership, nursing and science-based theories, and other discussed competencies will be beneficial for my future work.
It is also reasonable to mention that the 10 Strategic Points document and the Draft Prospectus require minor changes to ensure that they efficiently guide the DPI Project implementation. Prior to submitting my DPI Project Proposal to the Institutional Review Board (IRB), I should ensure that it meets all the requirements. It implies reading the document several times to identify any existing discrepancies and eliminating them. Possible issues can affect the content, intervention applicability, format, grammar, spelling, and others. Thus, I will do my best to ensure that my DPI Project Proposal meets the highest quality standards."
"Unemployment is a significant social and economic problem that affects individuals, families, and communities worldwide. This essay will discuss three leading causes of unemployment: inflation, advanced technology, and lack of education or skills for employment. Furthermore, it will explore the negative impacts of these factors and their contribution to this pervasive issue.
One of the primary causes of unemployment is inflation. When prices rise, consumers' purchasing power diminishes, leading to a decrease in demand for goods and services. Consequently, companies may struggle to maintain profitability and are often forced to downsize their workforce, resulting in job losses. Inflation can also discourage investment, hindering businesses from expanding and creating new employment opportunities. Consequently, the detrimental effects of inflation contribute significantly to the unemployment rate.
Advanced technology is another significant cause of unemployment. As innovative technologies continue to emerge, businesses increasingly rely on automation. While this enhances efficiency and productivity, it also displaces human workers. For instance, in many industries, machines can now perform tasks previously done by a multitude of employees. As a result, workers who lack the necessary technological skills to adapt find themselves unemployed. Therefore, the rapid advancement of technology undoubtedly contributes to the unemployment problem.
Lastly, a lack of education or skills for employment is a crucial factor in unemployment. In our evolving job market, demands for certain skills are constantly changing. Those who possess outdated or insufficient qualifications struggle to find suitable employment opportunities. This lack of skills or education not only leads to unemployment but also perpetuates socio-economic inequalities. Moreover, individuals facing unemployment due to their limited qualifications often struggle financially, leading to adverse psychological impacts and the potential for social unrest.
The negative impacts of these factors extend beyond individuals and seep into society and the economy. High unemployment rates strain public social welfare systems, increase poverty levels, and reduce tax revenues. This creates a cycle of economic decline, as there is less money circulating in the economy, further reducing job opportunities. Additionally, unemployment fosters social unrest, erodes social cohesion, and can contribute to increased crime rates.
In conclusion, inflation, advanced technology, and a lack of education or skills have emerged as leading causes of unemployment. Their negative impacts encompass economic repercussions such as reduced consumer demand and investment, as well as social consequences of poverty and increased crime rates. Addressing these causes requires comprehensive solutions, including investing in education and training programs, promoting technological innovation that creates rather than displaces jobs, and implementing effective inflation management strategies. By mitigating these factors, societies can work towards reducing unemployment and fostering greater social and economic stability."
"Despite the low unemployment rate in the U.S, Black Americans are twice susceptible to unemployment compared to white Americans. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) recorded a 7.1% unemployment rate of African Americans compared to the national average of 4.2% (BLS, 2022). Racism and inequality in education in the U.S causes structural, cyclical, and frictional unemployment. Structural racism in education has disadvantaged Black Americans by offering them lower levers of education resulting in a higher unemployment rate as compared to the other races.
Systemic racism in the U.S. is the primary cause of the unemployment gap. Even with compatible qualifications, black workers are less likely to be employed than white workers causing structural unemployment. According to Montenovo et al. (2020), the majority of the job placements in the U.S are still filled through referrals without classified advertisements disadvantaging the blacks since most employers are whites. Racial divides in the U.S. and poor policies hinder equal and fair employment opportunities.
Compared to white Americans, African Americans have a relatively low rate of education in the U.S. High dropout rates by African Americans, the exorbitant cost of education, and poor performance in public institutions compared to private schools contribute mainly to the education gap. Education is directly consistent with the employment status, especially for high-skill jobs causing structural unemployment (Gezici & Ozay, 2020). The majority of the black labor force is restricted to low-skill jobs, mainly affected by cyclical and frictional unemployment.
The education disparities mean that African Americans have lower chances of getting jobs and the opportunities available to them are mainly in the blue-collar sectors. Differences in the labor market across racial ethnicity are attributable to racism and low education for African Americans. Racial profiling, the unequal opportunity to education, and lack of policy to curb referral employment. More aggressive legislative policies and action are required to combat systematic racism and educational mismatch to bridge the unemployment gap between black and white Americans."
"The differential association theory was developed in 1939 by the veteran sociologist Edwin Sutherland. The study explains how prohibited manners master’s in social establishments can lead to criminology. Multiple people grasp the mindsets, methods, and justifications for illegal techniques by interacting with different persons. According to Lokanan (2018), people can minimize fraud-related cases by understanding the theory to maneuver positive results in the organizations such as schools. Students in high school interact with distinct people who possess offensive habits, and misconducts occur during this period.
During my high school period, my classmates and other senior students abused drugs that caused a severe threat to their health. The use of alcohol and cocaine was considered a crucial practice by most cliques since they could access the drugs from the drug vendors in the nearest town. The drug dealers used to visit the school frequently to sell drugs to the addicted students within the school environment. Throughout my school experience, addictive students would rush to bathrooms to smoke, inject cocaine, and consume alcohol repeatedly. The actions arose since the learners’ parents could offer finances to the students hence, they could access the drugs.
Drug abuse can lead to negative consequences such as low educational attainment, well-being problems such as brain disorders, and crime in society. The substance-induced in the body changes the brain functions through repeated use which determines the person’s genetic constituents (Fernàndez-Castillo et al., 2021). Drugs such as cocaine have enormous influences on individuals’ life and, and if overdosed, death can occur. Some individuals are better genetically sensitive to developing cocaine addiction compared to others.
Cliques in high school who used drugs committed crimes and served imprisonment in various correctional facilities. Misconduct is one of the outcomes of drug violation whereby both educators and parents should maneuver new methodologies to remedy the problem. The provision of school-based education to the youth is one of the proposed techniques to minimize the use and abuse of drugs in schools (Montgomery et al., 2022). Educational interventions in schools can boost cognitive-behavioral skills and decrease exposure to social forces that raise drug misuse. The study shows that multiple youths do not possess felony patterns in their adult life.
The theory illustrates that forty percent of people below 21 years old execute offenses in society. In addition, another feature such as growing up in a poor environment can lead to criminal behavior because of poverty or lack of necessities. Sutherlands argues that factors such as moral reasoning and freedom can control the intention of the people indulging in crimes (Brookes, 2021). Parents should ensure their children have the basic needs by engaging them in school-based education and non-curriculum activities such as games to avoid misconduct.
The approach explains how people should understand the purpose of declining fraud in the social domains. The utilization of the material is a crucial source to curb the behavior and improve the student’s performance by offering health education. Parents and tutors should play their roles effectively by taking actions such as punishing the learners who bully others or commit offenses during their high school life. Culture has also influenced young people to join organized syndicates where many young individuals have lost their lives. It is critical to educate the youths about the consequences of the breach and drug misuse to minimize the demeanor in society. Education can support youthful people to gain motivation by acquiring proper skills during school life and making reasonable decisions."
"“The Passing of Traditional Societies” is based on empirical material obtained from fieldwork and interviews conducted over a decade in Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, Jordan, and Iran. Lerner proceeded from the fact that in the process of modernization, all societies move in the same direction, which was set by the Western countries that had completed modernization earlier. However, this “Western model,” according to Lerner, is, in fact, global. It acquired its name only due to a historical confluence of circumstances. Countries of the North Atlantic were the first to carry out the processes of secularization, urbanization, and industrialization. Analyzing the modernization of lifestyles based on empirical material, Lerner pays the most attention to the growth of population mobility, the spread of literacy, and the mass media.
For example, Lerner dwelled on the problem of restrictions for modernization. Among the most critical factors hindering development, he attributed ethnocentrism. Lerner states, “From the West came the stimuli which undermined traditional society in the Middle East; for the reconstruction of a modern society that will operate efficiently” (Lerner 47). The author contrasts societies, at the same time declaring that the focus on cultural identity impedes progress.
I believe that this concept of modernization designed to solve the problems of transition from “backwardness” to “modernity” was a specific product of the era after the Second World War. Built on numerous simplifications, the modernization theory interprets the historical process as one-line and non-alternative (Dunmire 23). The paradigm proposed by Lerner does not explain the development principles of many countries, such as China, Russia, or Cuba, and therefore loses its relevance in modern days."
"Introduction:
Domestic violence is a persistent societal issue that requires an effective legal framework for protecting victims. This essay aims to discuss the three primary types of domestic violence arrest laws in the United States: mandatory arrest, pro-arrest, and permissive arrest laws. Furthermore, it will analyze the strengths and limitations associated with each type, focusing on re-offending rates, and evaluate the impact of mandatory arrest policies on victims and the preservation of families.
Mandatory Arrest Laws:
Mandatory arrest laws, as the name suggests, oblige law enforcement to make an arrest in response to a domestic violence incident with no discretion. Advocates argue that these laws prioritize victim safety while strengthening deterrence through consistent legal action. Research in jurisdictions with stringent mandatory arrest policies presents a correlation with reduced re-offending rates, suggesting the efficacy of this measure in protecting victims and deterring future domestic violence acts.
However, mandatory arrest laws also possess certain limitations. Critics argue that they may deter victims from reporting violence due to fear of the consequences for perpetrators, particularly in cases where arrest could lead to the loss of the main breadwinner in a family. Moreover, mandatory arrest policies disregard contextual factors and may inadvertently result in the arrest of victims themselves in self-defense situations. This unintended consequence can further traumatize victims and undermine the overall preservation of families.
Pro-Arrest Laws:
Pro-arrest laws prioritize the protection of victims while granting law enforcement officers discretion to evaluate each situation individually. This approach aims to consider the unique circumstances of each case, such as the severity of the violence and any prior history of abuse. Pro-arrest laws address the limitations of mandatory arrest policies and provide some flexibility that can better protect victims and preserve family units.
Nevertheless, the discretionary nature of pro-arrest laws has been associated with varying levels of enforcement and inconsistency in response across jurisdictions. This inconsistency can undermine victim trust and discourage reporting. Additionally, research on re-offending rates tied to pro-arrest laws shows mixed results, indicating that this approach, though offering some benefits, may not consistently prevent future domestic violence incidents.
Permissive Arrest Laws:
Permissive arrest laws grant officers discretion to make an arrest when they have probable cause to believe a domestic violence incident occurred. While supporters argue that this approach allows for individualized responses, critics assert that it can result in underreporting and a lack of accountability.
Conclusion:
The fight against domestic violence necessitates effective legal measures that prioritize victim safety and prevent re-offending. While mandatory arrest laws display potential in reducing re-offending rates, they should be carefully implemented to avoid unintended consequences. Pro-arrest and permissive arrest laws, meanwhile, offer more context-driven approaches but need consistent enforcement and oversight. Achieving a balance between victim protection and preserving families is crucial when designing domestic violence arrest laws in the United States."
"Religion is a fundamental part of most world societies and cultures. There are numerous varieties of religions worldwide with a wide range of differences than similarities. This factor makes it challenging to have an all-encompassing definition of religion that works for all people. The most common traits among the religions include the focus on supernatural or sacred power, ritual acts, and moral codes. Some regions are easily recognized globally, while others are confined to a particular region or country. For instance, Shinto is a Japanese religion widely practiced by that country’s nationals. Although Shinto is a Japanese religion, its myth of origin that supports the divinity of the country’s islands and rulers to ancestral lineage with gods can have a similarity to other religions such as Jewish and Christianity. Divinity
The Shinto Divinity Myth about Japanese Islands and Japanese Emperors
As noted in the introduction, most Japanese communities subscribe to Shinto, an indigenous religion that defines the country’s culture and national identity. According to Mizumura, more than fifty percent of Japanese adhere to Shinto. Shinto myth supports the notion that the Japanese islands are divine by indicating that they were created by gods, Izanami and Izanagi. The two gods used a spear encrusted with jewels to stir the ocean, where crystalized salt on the tip fell after withdrawing it, forming the islands. The gods settled on Onogoro-Shima, the first island they created, and the female deity, Izanami, wedded Izanagi. Later, the divine couple created other islands that comprise Japan, the world, and other gods.
Shinto myth also holds that the Japanese emperors are direct descendants of Amaterasu. According to Mizumura, Amaterasu Omikami, the sun goddess, was of the gods created by Izanami and wedded Iznagi, from whom the Shinto religion believes that the imperial family descended. Therefore, the Japanese people considered their emperors to have qualities of Kami, making them superior. The people obeyed the emperors and divine rulers and worshipped them. The emperors executed religious and political roles in society, such as performing rituals and protecting the country. Shinto’s divinity notion about their land and rulers is relatable to other religions.
The Jewish Story about “The Holy Land” and Shinto’s Divine Land
The Jewish story about God creating and giving “The Holy Land” has significant similarities with the Shinto myth concerning Japanese islands. The Jewish believe that their land is divine, created by God’s supreme supernatural being, and given to their forefathers and descendants. The story began when God asked Abraham, from whom the Jewish descended, to leave his native land for another that He (God) would show him (The Jewish virtual library). God gave Abraham a divine promise that He would bless the latter and make his name promise. God made a covenant with Abraham, saying He gave his descendants the land (The Jewish virtual library). Canaan, or Israel as known today, is the “Holy Land” endowed to the Jewish community. God fulfilled his promise when He used Moses to take the descendants of Abraham from Egypt to the promised. The Jewish right to the land of Canaan shows that God had already planned that the place would be an everlasting possession for the Jews.
Similarly, Shintonians believe that the Japanese islands were created and given to the Japanese community to inherit. Although the Jewish “Holy Land” was created by one Supreme God and the divine Japanese islands by more than one God, the creators were both supernatural beings with the powers to control humans and nature. Like Jewish who believe that God’s power and favor have always been upon their land and consider Israel a center for adoring their Creator, Shinto has numerous shrines in Japan for worshipping their gods.
The Notion of America as God’s Country and Shinto Message
Although several countries worldwide have ever identified themselves as a nation of God, they cannot contest the title “God’s own country” with America. The factors that make most Americans consider their nation as God’s country range from a religious perspective to the prosperity and freedom associated with it. According to Perry et al., American civil religion and Christian nationalism are religious factors that make citizens consider their nation as a country of God (131). The American civil religion considers Americans as united under an ambiguous Creator’s (Judeo-Christian) covenant (131). The citizens are obliged to the Creator because He maintains an equitable and just society. Conversely, Christian nationalism aligns the country’s national identity with an evangelical Christian God. America is among the most economically developed country and one of the world’s superpowers. Living in the country is associated with prosperity and freedom, which are God’s providence.
This notion of America as God’s country is similar to the Shinto myth that Japanese islands were created and belonged to gods. Both perspectives associate particular countries with religions, Christianity for America and Shinto for Japan. Americans, most of whom are Christians, believe that God is responsible for the country. Equally, Shintonians believe that the gods who created the islands are responsible for their land’s high production.
The Egyptian Concept of the Pharaoh as God and the Shinto Belief about the Japanese Emperor
Shinto belief about the Japanese emperor is similar to the ancient Egyptians’ concept of the pharaoh as a god. Notably, pharaohs were the prehistoric Egyptian rulers who played political and religious roles in society. The Egyptians considered their rulers divine, who linked the people and gods (National Society). The pharaohs maintained religious harmony among the residents of the region. Additionally, they participated in different important ceremonies and were head of state, made laws, and oversaw all operations in the land of Egypt. Likewise, Shinto believes that Japanese emperors are divine and worshiped because they are descendants of gods who created Japanese islands. Like the pharaohs, Japanese emperors are also considered important religious leaders by Shintonians.
The European Notion of the King’s Divine Right and Shinto Belief about the Japanese Emperor
Kings were an important symbol in most communities across the world. However, some parts, such as the European region, believed that their kings had divine rights from God. According to Wills, the kings derived their authority from God, and no earthly power could hold them accountable for their actions. The medieval notion that God grants power to leaders formed the foundation of the divine rights perception. The first proponent of the divine right of kings in the European region was King James I of England (Wills). Theorists of that notion asserted that authority is sacred and derived from God, even though the king is a person. This belief is not different from Shinto’s, who consider Japanese emperors to have extraordinary power and authority derived from gods. Shinto holds that emperors are descendants of the goddess Amaterasu. Therefore, no human should question their actions because divine powers guide them.
Christian Notion about Jesus and Shinto Belief about Japanese Emperors
The Christian belief about Jesus also shares some similarities with the Shinto notion about Japanese emperors. The Christians stoutly acknowledge that Jesus was the son of God, who is the most supreme and with supernatural power. Jesus was not born like other human beings but conceived through the Holy Spirit. Equally, they believe that Jesus is the leader of the Christian religion since it originated from his teachings. On the other hand, the Shinto notion holds that emperors are sun goddess Amaterasu, a highly recognized supernatural being in the religion. Although Japanese emperors were born, their origin is associated with divine beings. Like Jesus, Japanese emperors are considered the leaders of Shintonians and are the essential symbol of the religion.
Indeed, religions are a fundamental part of most societies and cultures. Most people in the world have ever associated themselves with one or more religions in their lifetime. While some religions are easily recognized globally, others, like Shinto, are confined to a particular region or country. Shinto myth of origin that supports the divinity of the country’s islands and rulers to ancestral lineage with gods can have a similarity to other religions. For instance, the Jewish and the Shinto believe that their lands are divine and given by supernatural beings. Equally, Shinto, Egyptians, and medieval European believed that their rulers were divine and their authority came from gods, so no earthly power could question or hold them accountable for their actions."
"Chapter 12 describes the events of the colonization of the Americas in 1450-1600, including the conquest of the southern continent and the types of trade that affected Asia, Africa, and Europe. The chapter begins by explaining why the more active and aggressive empires, the Ottoman and Chinese, were not involved in the colonization of the lands in South and North America (Adelman et al., 2015, p. 475). The authors note that the peoples of many Asian countries for centuries had only a vague idea of the scope and importance of Columbus’ discovery. This discovery, through increased trade and interaction between peoples, changed the borders of states on new continents and the ways of life of the inhabitants of European, African, and Asian countries. Interestingly, China had a particular role in international relationships as a country whose population was one-third of the world.
It is noted that the expansion to the west was partly an experiment, resulting in the concepts of the New and Old Worlds. Afterward, the control of information from various parts of the world has become a source of political power (Adelman et al., 2015, p. 478). It is also described how the Ottoman Empire, which had already conquered Byzantium, the Balkans, and cut in the Venecians’ empire, conquered Syria and Egypt in 1516-1517. The Ottoman Empire failed to conquer Iran when faced with the Safavid, who established a Shia state on the Iranian plateau. Notably, the subsequent plans of the Ottoman Empire to conquer Europe coincided with the Protestant movement led by Martin Luther. The authors also discuss the presence of the Portuguese in Africa and Asia in the context of the ‘clash’ of the continents. Key topics include navigation and military advances, sugar and slavery, commerce and conquest in the Indian Ocean, and the conquered Atlantic world.
Chapter 13 discusses the further mingling of relationships between the New and Old Worlds, China, Africa, and Europe. The emergence of the mercantilism concept in global commerce is given special attention. Europeans see mercantilism as an understanding that valuable resources such as gold and silver are limited in the world as a whole and the desire to get these resources into their treasury.
After the Spaniards seized most of the gold and silver in South America, other European countries tried to obtain these resources by selling cash crops like tobacco and sugar and through government-sanctioned pirate attacks on merchant ships (Adelman et al., 2015, p. 520). Further, the authors describe the Little Ice Age in the 17th century, when a cold snap and drought caused reforestation after the extinction of millions of cities in South America as a result of diseases introduced by the Spaniards (Adelman et al., 2015, p. 524). Then, the expansion in North America is described, including the settlement of the first states by Europeans on the Atlantic coast.
The comparative perspectives on climate change in the Ottoman and Ming empires are equally interesting. In these empires, the Little Ice Age caused severe rebellion and unrest among the peasants who faced famine. The cold hit the eastern Mediterranean parts of the Ottoman Empire the hardest, where the situation was additionally destabilized by the import of New World silver leading to inflation. What started as unrest in Anatolia province eventually led to the end of the Ottoman Empire, which never restored its power and influence, although the uprising was followed by a prosperous period in the late seventeen’s century. The weakening of the state prompted Egypt, Syria, and other Arab provinces to assert autonomy.
The Little Ice Age was deadly for the Ming dynasty, which did not survive and was later replaced by the Qing dynasty. In Beijing, an estimated 300,000 citizens perished from hunger; food shortages pushed the Manchu to China, adding to destabilization (Adelman et al., 2015, p. 537). Eventually, the charismatic rebellion leader Li Zicheng seized Beijing in 1644. The New World silver undermined the Chinese economy, with the peasants bearing the heaviest burden."
"Medical institutions function to protect the interests of patients and meet their needs; they are now the object of attention of society as a whole. The population’s confidence in the activities of medical organizations is an essential indicator of their effectiveness. Bringing current terminology and the nature of the relationship between patients and physicians into a state of certainty will help to understand and delineate the nature of consumerism in health care (Calnal, 2010). The absence or lack of trust is of particular concern to patients. They feel vulnerable not only because they are sick but also because of the research and treatment they have to undergo. Improving the efficiency of the health care system is a policy priority for European countries.
In today’s world, patients expect adequate professional skills from doctors and high standards of interpersonal communication. In recent years, they have become more aware of medical options and the kind of care they can receive at specific medical organizations. Patients are increasingly comparing options at different clinics, learning a lot of information about doctors and medical services, as well as publicly available information about diseases (Calnan, 2010). The shortcomings of medical care, not the assertive consumerism, are causing the growing interest in self-education among patients. A negative consequence of this trend is the widespread use by patients of Internet materials for self-diagnosis and treatment. The vulnerability of patients undergoing treatment can be reduced by restoring trust between them and the treating physician. Moreover, appropriate training and highly qualified doctors are factors that determine how friendly and relaxed the clinics’ clients will be about the manipulations they undergo. The destruction of the interpersonal relationship between doctors and patients due to the introduction of depersonalized procedures becomes the subject of research in the coming years."
"One of the main purposes of a leader of a business is to select the best course of action out of the available alternatives when it comes to the process of decision-making. Clearly enough, it is impossible without a thorough understanding of a company’s business environment. When it comes to entering the market with the goods for the purchasers’ consumption, the one theory that specialists often take to is the supply and demand theory. This theory is utilized to understand the customers’ buying behaviors and help managers strategize the product in the market in accordance with them. For instance, a lack of demand for the product signifies that supply needs to be shortened – and vice versa: when there is an increase of demand, it is reasonable to enhance supply of goods as well. Additionally, a supply and demand analysis helps in pricing: if the demand for the product is high, buyers are more likely to accept price increases an keep on purchasing it. With the low demand, however, prices should be sufficiently affordable; otherwise, the producer will suffer losses.
There are various strategies to make the supply and demand model work to one’s advantage. Dayton cites an example of De Beers – a company specializing in creating diamond jewelry. Their vaults are filled with diamonds – but they manage to maintain high prices for gems by limiting supply. Thus, diamonds keep staying a rare commodity, for the acquisition of which as a status symbol purchasers willingly pay. Another organization using the supply and demand theory to their advantage is Zappo. Dayton states that the company’s primary idea of selling shoes online – that is, with no option of trying them on beforehand – did not seem like a good one. However, Zappo became a success story by having gained control over supply – their enormous assortment, excellent customer service, and a favorable return policy make buyers choose them time and time again. Finally, there is Apple – a renowned giant of the technology market. Their building of anticipation for the release of a service or a product is a manufacturing demand that makes purchasers feel like they are a part of something bigger than simply another gadget’s market entry. In conclusion, a supply and demand theory can definitely be used as a tool for navigating the market – one only has to search for appropriate ways to use it to their product’s advantage."
"Introduction:
William Shakespeare's timeless masterpiece, 'Romeo and Juliet,' has been adapted numerous times throughout history. This essay aims to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of a new adaptation of the play, with a primary focus on how well it captures the themes inherent in the original work.
Strengths:
One of the notable strengths of the new adaptation is its ability to maintain the central themes of love and fate. The characters' passionate emotions and impulsive actions accurately reflect the intensity of Shakespeare's original text. Additionally, the new adaptation successfully captures the theme of societal conflict, using modern elements of rebellion and class divisions to mirror the feud between the Montagues and Capulets.
Furthermore, the adaptation introduces innovative ways of presenting the themes. The use of modern technology, such as social media platforms, strengthens the exploration of love's intensity and youthful impulsiveness. By incorporating these contemporary elements, the production effectively brings the timeless themes closer to a contemporary audience.
Weaknesses:
However, despite its strengths, the new adaptation falls short in capturing the nuances and depth of certain themes. The nuanced exploration of 'love at first sight' is one such example. The adaptation tends to focus more on the physical attraction between the central characters, neglecting the profound connection that Shakespeare's original play seeks to depict. This omission weakens the audience's understanding of the complexities and restrictions imposed on love during the Elizabethan era.
Additionally, the adaptation fails to adequately capture the theme of family feuds, which plays a pivotal role in the original play. While it does portray the rivalry between the Montagues and Capulets, there is a lack of emphasis on the consequences of this enmity. Shakespeare intended to highlight the destructive impact of familial conflicts, but the adaptation falls short in conveying this message effectively.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, the new adaptation of 'Romeo and Juliet' does possess several strengths regarding the portrayal of love, fate, and societal conflict. However, it falls short in capturing the complexity of themes such as 'love at first sight' and the consequences of family feuds. To effectively capture the multitude of themes presented in the original play, future adaptations should strive for a more balanced representation while incorporating contemporary elements to resonate with audiences across eras. Only by achieving this delicate balance can adaptations truly honor the enduring legacy of Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet.'"

"Introduction
With the contemporary global concerns about sustainable development, the issues of food waste and environmental protection have become more visible and better tackled. With prevalent problems of insufficient nutrition and food insecurity due to the disruption of conventional food consumption traditions, sustainable eating is threatened (Huambachano, 2019). Indeed, human eating habits and the overall culture of food consumption are subject to analysis to identify patterns that might yield an impact (positive or negative) on the environment from both short- and long-term perspectives. Daily practices of consuming food, cooking, grocery shopping, and managing leftovers and waste comprise the whole behavior of individuals in relation to food. They are commonly associated with the environmental worldview that prevails in a person’s overall outlook. Thus, it is relevant to revise and alter the environmental worldview to revise harmful or unsustainable eating habits by engaging in spiritual practices for better sustainable outcomes. This paper presents a reflective analysis of the author’s eating habit-informed environmental worldview, the health of their connection with nature, and probable spiritual practices to improve sustainable food consumption.
Environmental Worldview Analysis
The analysis of one’s environmental worldview should be based on the observation of practices and behaviors rather than assessed theoretically. In such a manner, the identification of a particular paradigm is more objective and realistic. For that matter, the basis for this analysis is the record of a seven-day eating habit journal that I have completed for the purposes of this project. The information recorder in the food habit spreadsheet allows for categorizing my environmental worldview as stewardship. This conclusion is validated by the limited waste I produce after each meal, which helps protect the environment from pollution and eliminates the threat of overproduction in the long-term perspective within food systems. Indeed, most days, I did not produce any waste, while on other days, no edible food was thrown away apart from some fries. Moreover, the stewardship environmental worldview entails caring for the planet by managing the consumption of resources. In this regard, my combining of occasional home-cooked meals with ordered food contributes to the balanced consumption of food.
In order to conduct a proper analysis of the environmental worldview based on my food consumption patterns, it is relevant to review my attitude from three core perspectives, namely philosophy, religion, and ethics. Within the philosophical continuum, my records of eating habits indicate that I am more inclined to materialistic philosophy. In particular, the review of the food habit worksheet demonstrates that the majority of my meals are taken when I am alone, with occasionally shared dinners with my family. Moreover, I often order food from fast-food restaurants to obtain food quickly and to my liking without putting in much effort. I do not spend too much money on meals, which validates my materialistic motivation toward food consumption.
When tackled from the point of view of religion, my eating habits indicate my alignment with pantheism, which implies the unity of the world and God. As evidenced by my food consumption patterns and the activities associated with them, I do not differentiate between the external world and God. I do not actively apply religious consideration to the validation of my food habits. However, when eating, I perceive this time-spending as a spiritual practice of connecting my body with the world. From the perspective of ethics, I most closely relate to anthropocentrism. I limit my worries about buying groceries and cooking food or selecting food that is guaranteed to be sustainably produced. Instead, I choose easily accessible food items to satisfy my immediate needs. In addition, I engage in parallel activities, such as watching TV, responding to emails, playing on the phone, and others while eating, which indicates my prioritization of my feelings and satisfaction of my needs.
Evaluation of the Relation to Nature
As my food habits imply, my relationship with nature is characterized by distancing and insufficient concern. In the majority of my meal records, I do not know where the food comes from, where the ingredients for the meals were produced, or what the production methods are. I am not concerned with these issues when I make my daily food choices. The information that I obtain about some of the food items on my menu comes primarily from the official websites of the companies from which I order. It might not be objective and does not provide any indication of the impact of my food choice on nature. Moreover, I am more concerned with the diversity of my diet, which is evident from the different choices I make, although within the limited range of cuisines. Thus, the environmental footprint of my eating habits is not a priority for me on a daily basis.
However, the identified stewardship environmental worldview encourages me to pay more attention to the sustainable use of natural resources when consuming food. In particular, the stewardship environmental worldview implies integrating the knowledge about the consequences of particular production methods for the planet and the reduction of harm through habit improvement. This approach allows for shifting the priority from an egocentric attitude toward eating habits to a more nature-centered one. In such a manner, the choice of places to eat and the items on the menu (or ingredients for home-cooked meals) should be aligned with the maximum benefit for humans and minimum harm to the planet.
Spiritual Eating-Related Practices for Healthier Relationship with Nature
Firstly, one of the spiritual practices related to my eating habits might be the initiation of family cooking evenings. There is much information online and on social media on cooking and promoting a healthy and nutritious diet with sustainable food management (Choudhary et al., 2019). Spending time on cooking will allow my family and me to connect, learn, and appreciate the nutritious food cooked ourselves. Moreover, I will have a chance to teach children about sustainable food consumption, thus making my contribution to the longevity of future generations. When selecting recipes and ingredients, I will be aware of the natural resources that are used to produce them and evaluate the threat to the planet. In such a manner, I will unite with nature and raise awareness about ingredients, their origin, nutrients, and health benefits. Moreover, this practice will help me manage food waste by practicing recipes for leftover-based cooking. Overall, by cooking more often, including some outdoor picnics, I will improve my relations with nature.
Secondly, I will transition to a vegetarian diet to eliminate the threats to the environment caused by meat production. Indeed, research suggests that “high meat consumption requires intensive farming and animal husbandry methods, which is particularly unhealthy” (Nemeth et al., 2019, p. 4). Moreover, in terms of spirituality and ethics, the refusal to consume animal-based foods will preserve animal life on the planet and reduce production-related damage to the soil and ecosystems.
Thirdly, another important practice that might improve my relationship with nature is buying groceries from farmers with a proper guarantee of the production of food items using sustainable production methods. The prioritization of organic food will be a significant contribution to sustainable food consumption with potential benefits in the long-term perspective of the planet and nature. I will apply rational thinking and informed decision-making when making food choices to make sure that the products I buy and consume are of zero harm to nature. Such a practice will promote sustainable consumption, support organic farming, and eliminate the harm of non-sustainable production in the long run.
Conclusion
In summation, the presented discussion was aimed at analyzing my environmental worldview, its implications for my relation to nature, and the generation of some spiritual practices to improve it. Overall, based on the worksheet records of my eating habits, it was determined that I most certainly align with the stewardship environmental worldview. This worldview allows for a certain degree of unawareness about sustainability issues with limited harm to nature. The limited waste I produce, partial concern about the place and practices of ingredient production I exhibit, and my use of both home-cooked and ordered food validate the selection of the environmental worldview. Within this perspective, my relations with nature are inconsistent and characterized by limited knowledge and limited contribution to environmental protection and sustainability issues despite the lack of harm to nature on my side. To improve my relationship with nature, I will use such spiritual practices as family cooking evenings, transitioning to a vegetarian diet, and buying from farmers with obtaining information about sustainable production methods."
"Drug addiction is a terrible epidemic that destroys many lives, and therefore many countries of the world are waging war on drugs. However, the methods used, insufficient data quality, and biases affecting the course of the struggle have negative consequences. Laws against drugs have a disproportionate impact on national minorities, women, and other oppressed groups. At the same time, the roots of the addiction problem, which lie in poverty and social inequality, are often ignored. Despite all the dangers of drugs, the fight against them should not worsen the living conditions for the population and aggravate injustice.
The problem of racism in America’s justice system is particularly acute. The American system is the largest globally and contains the most prisoners. At the same time, people of color, especially African-Americans, are detained more often. After detention, representatives of other races are more likely to be convicted and sentenced to harsher punishment. Such injustice is especially noticeable in the drug situation, where the number of crimes for different races is approximately the same (The Sentencing Project, 2018). The police distribute their efforts focusing on areas where they believe a crime is more likely, and policies like “Broken Windows” and “Stop, Question, and Frisk” make people of color the target (The Sentencing Project, 2018). Given the disproportionate level of poverty, structural racism, and small efforts to combat these problems, the drug war is a more significant burden for minorities.
The fight against drugs also unfairly affects women, especially women of color. Racial bias is also relevant to them, but several other problems supplement it. Women have less access than men to treatment during detention (Drug Policy Alliance, n.d.). Child protection policies fight drugs, and sometimes children can be taken from mothers only for suspicion of them in connection with drug crimes (Drug Policy Alliance, n.d.). Conspiracy laws are also severely used against women, imposing penalties for not informing about the involvement of a partner or family member in drug sales (Drug Policy Alliance, n.d.). Thus, existing laws against drugs are unfair to racial minorities and women."

"The suggested strategies to mitigate the effects of coronavirus in accordance with the example of Iceland could be considered as an interesting approach. This strategy acknowledges its apparent limitations, such as the resilience of the Iceland community, geographical idiosyncrasy. However, currently, this strategy might not be a valid method to address the high margins of infected individuals in NATO countries. It is certainly true that quick response and high testing rates would contribute to the deterrence of the effects imposed by the sudden growth of the number of infected. However, it is similarly meaningful that the population would be willing to undergo such a measure. Moreover, despite the financial support efforts, some countries belonging to the organization might not be able to financially withstand the high amount of testing imposed by the new waves of infection. This fact is especially relevant given that the virus dissemination might emerge across several countries simultaneously.
Therefore, a different approach to the problem might be necessary. The Israeli government approached the problem of monitoring the infected with the creative solution of digital epidemiological investigation (Amit et al., 2020). This technology allowed tracking potential contacts of people that were infected and act accordingly (Amit et al., 2020). However, it is arguable that this methodology could address the geographical limitations introduced in the case of Iceland. It would be difficult for NATO countries to strictly monitor all entrances to their borders. Therefore, an analog in the form of digital tracking may solve the problem with the need for strict borders control and provide necessary tools for timely reaction to the new outbreaks. Nevertheless, it would require funds both internal and external in order to build new or reconstruct the existing infrastructure for the stated purposes."
"Introduction (50 words)
Ageism, the discrimination or prejudice against individuals based on their age, is a pervasive issue in society. The media plays a profound role in shaping our perceptions and attitudes towards older adults. This essay aims to discuss the impact of ageism in the media by providing examples of both negative and positive portrayals, emphasizing the need for more accurate and empowering representations.
Negative Portrayals (150 words)
The media often perpetuates negative stereotypes regarding older adults, reinforcing ageism in our society. Fearful depictions of aging individuals as burdensome, dependent, or physically decrepit contribute to a prevailing bias against older people. For instance, advertisements frequently employ ageist tropes, presenting youthfulness as the ideal while equating aging with decline and irrelevance. Such portrayals can foster age-related discrimination and undermine the self-esteem and well-being of older individuals. By unfairly representing older adults as technologically inept or out of touch with contemporary issues, the media neglects to highlight their wisdom, experience, and contributions to society. These negative portrayals not only leave older adults feeling marginalized but also perpetuate harmful stereotypes that hinder intergenerational relationships.
Positive Portrayals (150 words)
Nevertheless, the media also presents opportunities to challenge ageism and promote positive perceptions of older adults. There are instances where movies, commercials, and television shows depict older characters as dynamic, intelligent, and capable individuals. For example, movies like ""Cocoon"" or ""The Intern"" demonstrate the value of intergenerational friendships, debunking the notion that older adults are out of touch. Commercials featuring active and vibrant older individuals engaging in sports, hobbies, and social activities help transform societal perceptions. Positive portrayals like these can challenge stereotypes, break down barriers between generations, and inspire a more inclusive and age-friendly society. Furthermore, media outlets that feature older adults as experts, mentors, or leaders in various fields contribute to dismantling ageism by demonstrating that age should not dictate a person's abilities or contributions.
Conclusion (50 words)
Ageism in the media has a profound impact on the way society perceives and treats older adults. While negative portrayals perpetuate stereotypes and foster discrimination, positive representations challenge these prejudices and pave the way for a more inclusive and age-diverse society. The media's role in changing narratives around aging is crucial, as accurate and empowering portrayals can promote intergenerational understanding, combat ageist biases, and ultimately foster a more inclusive society that values individuals regardless of their age."
"Introduction
An innovative home system is one of the unique modern technologies implemented by many intelligent systems: Ecobee Smart Thermostat – an intelligent design with software to control energy consumption. The device is medium-sized and consists of two parts: the thermostat with a glass display, a quad-core processor, and SmartSensor that picks up environmental signals. The thermostat has digital data transmission to the user and is compatible with the small detail and the user’s device. SmartSensor consists of air sensors (temperature, humidity, proximity, and occupancy) and a controlled voice assistant; it is automatically controlled by the thermostat and has built-in microphones, speakers, and speech recognition. Ecobee Smart Thermostat maintains a comfortable temperature and humidity in the home. The system allows you to reduce energy costs and regulate an environmental load of your home. The report describes the construction of the thermostat parts, their relationship to each other, and their control.
A Detailed Description of the Object
Thermostat
The thermostat is the central part of a rather large-sized device that controls an intelligent system with sensors. This part can convert the signal received from the sensor using a powerful processor and record the data on a memory card. The next-generation Cortex A35 processor allows for high performance with less energy to run its costs. One can see the scheme of a processor in figure 1.
Figure 1: Scheme of Cortex A35 processor
Due to the economical operation of the processor, the thermostat runs offline for long periods. The robust process ensures interfacing with other home components such as electric light sources, heat pumps, humidifiers, fans and dryers, and users’ mobile devices. The small RAM , which stores the currently running machine code, is enough to serve the device at high speed. The built-in memory is only 4 gigabytes, but this amount is enough to store the comfort settings set by the user. The thermostat uses communication channels to connect to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth 5.0. The allowable settings are Wi-Fi up to 5 GHz, the possibility of IP addressing, and the identifier of the device in the network is extended to static or dynamic (DHCP).
Thermostat Connection
The thermostat consists of an enclosure with elements for communication with the house’s internal systems and a glass display, which provides digitalization of the data. The case size is 6.2 inches by 6.2 inches, and the display size is 4.29 inches by 4.29 inches – a compact enough unit that can be easily placed anywhere. There is a hole in the enclosure through which to run the cables for those elements of the house that need to be controlled: electricity, fans, and cleaning systems. Figure 2 shows the in-build elements below the thermostat display.
Figure 2: Thermostat’s Elements under the Display
The available wire terminals are Rh, C, Y1 and Y2, PEK, O/B, and others. The AC connection is within 24 V via the C and Kc terminals, providing up to 3.5 VA of power. After connecting all the wires, the device must be started by allowing the internal settings to control the connected systems. The LCD display shows the corresponding characteristics : date, time, location, humidity, temperature, and amount of energy consumed. The information requested by the user is transmitted to the mobile or other devices on-demand or automatically. All settings can be adjusted according to the user’s needs.
Smart Sensor with Voice Control
An optional part of the Ecobee Smart Thermostat is a small part with temperature and motion sensors. The sensor also recognizes voice commands and connects to Siri, Alexa, and other voice assistants. The sensor is small (1.6 inches by 2 inches) and consists of a plastic-metal housing and a stand. Figure 3 shows the sensor from two perspectives.
Figure 3: Smart Sensor
The sensor is placed anywhere in the apartment but 20 feet from the thermostat. It preserves signal transmission, which uses 915 MHz radio waves. The sensors have a viewing angle of up to 140 degrees horizontally and 100 degrees vertically. Sensors recognize the temperature in the room by using a chip with the perception of infrared radiation . The device acknowledges thermal objects in the same pattern: the temperature of passing objects will be higher, and the SmartSensor sends a signal to the thermostat. The thermal signals are received to trigger a command to the device, and the machine can regulate the heating or cooling of the room. The device is powered by the CR-2477 battery included in the package.
Conclusion
Ecobee Smart Thermostat is an intelligent device that allows you to regulate the temperature and humidity in the room and monitor the energy consumption of home maintenance. The device consists of a thermostat with an LCD display and a network location in the housing and a SmartSensor with sensors and a voice recognition system. This system allows you to monitor the state of the central system of the house – electricity, and due to the powerful processors and the use of the economical battery, the consumer’s costs are reduced."

The book describes the main acts carried out by the group, as well as its fundamental motives. In that way, the source includes information on the 1978 bank robberies and other violent actions that ultimately led to the Sri Lankan Civil War. Additionally, LTTE’s objective to create an independent and separate state for Sri Lankan Tamils, who the government had previously oppressed, is reviewed. The research source is relevant for investigating the goals of the terrorist group, as well as explaining the establishment of an independent Tamil state. Therefore, it would be helpful for my analysis of LTTE’s emergence process.
Thurairajah, T. (2021). Performing nationalism: The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and Sri Lankan Tamil diasporic politics in Switzerland . The Geographical Journal, 188 (1). Web.
The themes of Tamil nationalism are explored in the following source. The article highlights ways through which the Sri Lankan minority groups acknowledged their right to an independent state and how such groups shared their ideology beyond their country. The source’s relevancy to the exploration of the group’s ideology is evident, as it explains its impact on the rest of the world. It was useful in the process of defining the concept of Tamil nationalism in my paper.

"It is important to note that it is highly common for one culture not to be able to understand the state, internal struggles, and intricacies of a different culture. The given notion is called ethnocentrism, where one’s perspective and views are centered around his or her own culture. For example, the book states: “people in America don’t understand, but when an American chain opens in a third-world country, people go crazy” (Noah 188). As a person living in Canada, I embody Canadian culture, where most people from developing nations might not fully understand that a mere fast food restaurant chain is not such a thrilling occurrence for regular consumers. The book also states that “Westerners are shocked and confused by that, but it’s a case of the West reaping what it has sown. The colonial powers carved Africa, put the black man to work, and did not properly educate him” (Noah 194). Similarly, many assume that Canadian people are excessively polite as part of the culture, but I would want others to know that it is not the case.
One of the most interesting aspects of the book is how certain tyrants are not perceived as such in other places due to the lack of their relevance, which is why it is true for current leaders in Canada as well. The text states: “so in Europe and America, yes, Hitler is the Greatest Madman in History, In Africa, he’s just another strongman from history books” (Noah 196). Although Canada did not have such tyrants, many people outside Canada perceive that our leaders are perfect and representative of true democracy. However, it is not always true because they also face challenges for power struggles and do not always behave in the nation’s best interests, which are becoming more evident in recent events."
"Introduction:
Sociology offers a multifaceted lens through which to understand the intricate connection between race and health disparities. By developing comprehensive definitions of race and examining the environmental context of health, sociologists have contributed crucial insights into this complex issue. This essay will discuss the contributions of sociology towards unveiling the race-health connection, drawing upon the works of Hummer (1996) and Kwate (2008) to highlight specific examples.
Race as a Social Construct:
Sociologists acknowledge that race is not a biological fact but a social construct with profound implications for health outcomes. Hummer (1996) argues that considering race as a social construct allows us to analyze how social and cultural factors intersect with biology to shape health disparities. This perspective helps identify patterns of disadvantage experienced by racial and ethnic groups. For instance, the Black-White health gap in the United States can be attributed, in part, to the social determinants of health such as discrimination, socio-economic status, and access to quality healthcare.
Examining the Environmental Context of Health:
Sociology explores the broader social and environmental factors that contribute to health disparities among different racial and ethnic groups. Kwate (2008) illustrates how the racial residential segregation and neighborhood characteristics influence health outcomes. For instance, in segregated neighborhoods characterized by limited healthy food options and exposure to environmental pollutants, residents experience higher rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes or asthma. This highlights the importance of analyzing the social environments in which individuals live to comprehend the root causes of health disparities.
The Intersectionality of Race and Health:
Sociology recognizes that race intersects with other socially constructed identities, such as gender and class, leading to unique health experiences. For instance, Hummer (1996) shows that the health disadvantage experienced by Black women is not solely due to their race, but also shaped by their gender. The intersectionality perspective emphasizes the importance of considering multiple dimensions of social identity to understand the complexities of health disparities.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, sociology contributes profoundly to understanding the connection between race and health disparities through the development of race as a social construct, examination of the environmental context of health, and embracing intersectionality. Hummer (1996) and Kwate (2008) exemplify these contributions by providing tangible examples that highlight the interplay between various sociocultural factors and health outcomes. By unraveling the intricate dynamics between race and health, sociology helps identify actionable strategies to reduce disparities and promote health equity, fostering a society where everyone can thrive."
"Introduction:
Import duties can significantly impact a company's financial standing, increasing the cost of imported goods and resources. To minimize these financial burdens and enhance profitability, companies can adopt various strategies. This essay will discuss two effective approaches that organizations can implement to reduce import fees and optimize their operations: diversifying supply chains and engaging in duty drawback programs.
Body:
1. Diversifying Supply Chains:
Diversifying supply chains is an effective strategy to minimize import duties and mitigate the financial impact on companies. By having multiple suppliers in different regions, organizations can reduce their dependency on particular countries and negotiate better pricing terms. This allows companies to explore alternative markets with lower import duties or identify countries with favorable trade agreements.
a) Supplier Network Expansion: Companies can proactively expand their supplier network by establishing relationships with vendors in diverse regions. This ensures that they have a wide selection of suppliers to choose from, reducing the risk of being locked into costly import fees due to limited choices.
b) Localization of Production: Another aspect of diversifying supply chains is the localization of production in different countries or regions. By establishing subsidiary manufacturing facilities in areas that offer lower import duties or are closer to the target markets, companies can avoid or reduce import fees. Localization also enables organizations to be more responsive to market demands and reduce transportation costs.
2. Duty Drawback Programs:
Engaging in duty drawback programs is a systematic approach whereby companies can reclaim import duties paid on imported goods that are subsequently re-exported or used in the production of exported goods. Implementing duty drawback programs can provide several financial benefits to organizations:
a) Identification and Tracking: Effective implementation of duty drawback programs requires companies to accurately identify and track imported goods that are eligible for duty drawbacks. Establishing robust internal systems to monitor inventory and record the origin and usage of goods can facilitate more successful claims.
b) Submission of Claims: Timely and accurate submission of duty drawback claims plays a crucial role in maximizing financial gains. Companies should ensure they have a streamlined process for submitting claims, backed by thorough documentation and adherence to the regulatory requirements of the countries involved.
Conclusion:
Minimizing the financial impact of import duties and enhancing profitability for companies requires strategic planning and a proactive approach. By diversifying supply chains and engaging in duty drawback programs, organizations can effectively reduce import fees, optimize their operations, and improve their bottom line. Adopting these strategies not only helps companies mitigate the financial challenges associated with import duties but also enhances their competitiveness in the global market."

"Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes contrast based on their definitions, the causes, and the management of the conditions. Type 1 manifests through the pancreas producing little to no insulin, which is why it is essential to monitor the glucose levels in the blood (DiMeglio et al., 2018). People who are genetically predisposed are the target groups, and the condition can correlate with symptoms such as thirst, weight loss, and feelings of hunger. Type 2 diabetes occurs when the pancreas does not create enough insulin while cells do not have an adequate reaction to the insulin that is being produced (Roden & Shulman, 2019). Research shows that more than 90% of Americans with diabetes are diagnosed with Type 2, while less than 6% have Type 1 (Xu et al., 2018). Thus, lifestyle is the most critical factor in terms of prevention and treatment.

Based on the fact that Type 1 diabetes correlates with low insulin production while the second type is linked to inadequate response to insulin, managing this hormone that has the function of facilitating the glucose to enter the cell is essential. Moreover, since the gene that regulates the production of resistin is overactive in people with obesity, it is evident that a diet that can reduce excess weight while addressing other diabetes-specific concerns can reduce risks.
Multiple diets claim to be effective in terms of managing type 2 diabetes, yet multiple factors have to be considered. For example, the Atkins diet mainly consists of products high in fiber and low in saturated fat. Since the CDC promotes the avoidance of saturated fat and the increase of fiber intake for sugar regulation, the Atkins diet may be suited for people with diabetes ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021). On the other hand, a reduction in carbs may lead to poor glycemic control (Joshi et al., 2019). Thus, the diet has both pros and cons depending on circumstances.
Marketing claims regarding supplements, powders, and teas also target demographics looking for ways to reduce weight. For example, researchers refer to the commonly used ephedra supplements as potentially beneficial in short-term weight loss but mention side effects such as heart and nervous system (Miao et al., 2020). Garcinia cambogia has shown to be ineffective in weight loss and correlates with reports of liver damage ( US Department of Health and Human Services , 2022). Multiple teas, supplements, and powders that claim to be helpful for weight loss are unethically marketed since FDA often finds unlisted ingredients such as sibutramine, which increases blood pressure ( Center for Drug Evaluation and Research , 2022). Instead of opting for uncertified supplements, effective diabetes control correlates with a lifestyle change, including frequent exercise and a healthy and balanced diet. These measures are not only effective in terms of weight loss through calorie intake reduction but also beneficial for glucose regulation.
The case study presents three options, Savannah’s recommendation of following the Atkins diet, Alan’s claim that exercise and healthy eating can lead to positive results, and grandfather’s option of natural remedies. As a low-carb diet, Atkins may be effective since obesity treatment often relies on a carb reduction (Westman & Yancy, 2020). However, Alan’s recommendation of approaching the condition with a balanced overview on health based on activity and avoidance of certain foods is easier to follow and, possibly, more sustainable in the long run (Rubin & Herreid, 2003). Implementing natural remedies may be harmful since, as mentioned prior, researchers refer to the low efficacy and side effects. Thus, Morgan should maintain a healthy weight through balanced meals and higher activity levels."
"The current global landscape of the agricultural economy is composed of large companies. In fact, their presence is prevalent enough to dictate and formulate policies and standards within the industry (Chemnitz et al., 2017). In practice, this has resulted in a number of discrepancies such as environmental damages, violations of human and labor rights, and even the lack of effort to minimize poverty. While the scale of the issue may seem too large to resolve, alterations of consumer buying habits have the potential to foster diversity within such industries. However, buying habits are only a small fragment of a number of interventions that are necessary. Perhaps the most vital change that is missing includes government presence.
The most interesting aspect of the reading to me was focused on how the current size of the agricultural market was attained. The most prominent driver of such expansion was technological advancements that led to fundamental changes within the institution of the agricultural economy. Because machines were able to harvest in abundant amounts compared to employees, this created a substantial raise within the supply component of the economy. Companies also gained the upper hand by being able to sell quantities of crops before they were even sown. Such growth allowed even further expansion, though global companies would infrequently observe the effects of their actions on the planet, people in poverty, or farmers.
Another interesting factor of the rapid and substantial expansion of the agricultural market was the evolution of food retail. Essentially, the effectiveness of retail operations currently influences purchasing habits and product availability, especially within developing and developed countries. As such, from an economic perspective, the size of a food retail firm dictates its influence over both the consumer choice and which suppliers are selected. The monopolization that currently exists within the market is problematic, mainly due to the fact that such firms disregard the issues of modern agricultural processes."
"Introduction (approx. 60 words)
In the contemporary era, the media holds immense power over shaping the minds of young children. This essay will explore the extent to which media products designed for children reinforce capitalist values, utilizing the perspectives of Adorno's concept of industrial culture and structural functionalism. By examining specific examples from modern culture and society, this analysis seeks to provide insights into the underlying motivations and consequences that arise from the portrayal of capitalist ideals in children's media.
Adorno's Concept of Industrial Culture and Capitalism (approx. 90 words)
Adorno argues that industrial production and its resulting mass culture inherently serve the interests of capitalism. Media products for children, designed to maximize profits, tend to perpetuate capitalist values such as individualism, consumerism, and the glorification of material possessions. For instance, children's television programs frequently promote the consumption of branded merchandise, furthering the commodification of childhood experiences. By encouraging an early identification with consumerism, media products reinforce capitalist values and contribute to the reproduction of social inequality.
Comparison to Structural Functionalism (approx. 90 words)
Contrasting Adorno's perspective, structural functionalism suggests that media products for children reflect societal values and serve functional roles in socializing children. According to this theory, children's media ensures cultural continuity and prepares them for future roles in society. In this regard, capitalist values are presented as necessary components of a functioning society. For instance, popular animated movies often depict characters who succeed through hard work and determination, promoting the idea that individual effort leads to personal achievements and social progress.
Modern Examples and Consequences (approx. 60 words)
In contemporary culture, media products targeting children reinforce capitalist values in various ways. Advertising campaigns linked to children's programming often promote the acquisition of material goods as a source of happiness. Furthermore, video games and mobile applications centered around in-app purchases perpetuate the consumerist mindset. These examples illustrate how media products shape the attitudes and behaviors of young children, aligning them with capitalist values.
Conclusion (approx. 60 words)
Media products for children do indeed reinforce capitalist values in accordance with Adorno's concept of industrial culture. However, the perspective of structural functionalism suggests that such portrayal serves as a functional component of society. It is crucial to critically analyze and understand the implications of these dynamics to ensure the healthy development and socialization of children in an increasingly capitalist media landscape."
"Introduction:
Pandemics have challenged humanity throughout history, with Typhoid Fever and COVID-19 being two notable examples. This essay aims to compare and contrast the pandemics caused by the Typhoid and COVID-19 viruses, highlighting the cases of Typhoid Mary and Novak Djokovic. It will delve into their exposure to the illnesses and the impacts of their infections on their families and associates. Moreover, it will discuss the advancements in medical counter-measures and healthcare system preparedness observed over the past century that have aided in managing pandemics.
Comparison of Typhoid Mary and Novak Djokovic:
Typhoid Mary, a pseudonym given to Mary Mallon, was an asymptomatic carrier of the typhoid bacterium. In contrast, Novak Djokovic, a renowned tennis player, contracted COVID-19. Both individuals were exposed to their respective illnesses under different circumstances. Mary Mallon's exposure resulted from her occupation as a cook, where she contaminated food, leading to multiple outbreaks. Djokovic, on the other hand, contracted COVID-19 after participating in an exhibition tennis tournament, where several players tested positive.
Impact on Families and Associates:
Mary Mallon's infections had a severe impact on the families and associates of the households she worked in. Several residents fell ill and some even succumbed to the disease. Due to Mary's resistance to accepting her carrier status, the authorities had to take drastic measures, including isolating her for a significant period. Djokovic's infection had a widespread impact within the tennis community, resulting in added precautions and the cancellation of subsequent tournaments. His positive test brought attention to the importance of following safety protocols and protecting others.
Advancements in Medical Counter-measures and Healthcare System Preparedness:
Over the past century, significant advancements have occurred in medical counter-measures and healthcare system preparedness, augmenting the ability to handle subsequent pandemics. With the advent of vaccines and antibiotics, the Typhoid Fever pandemic significantly declined in Western countries. Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic witnessed remarkable progress in the development of multiple effective vaccines within an unprecedented timeframe. Additionally, surveillance systems, rapid diagnostic tests, and improved treatment protocols have been pivotal in managing and containing outbreaks.
Conclusion:
The pandemics caused by Typhoid Fever and COVID-19 have left lasting impacts on society, with the cases of Typhoid Mary and Novak Djokovic offering distinct perspectives. Despite the differences in the exposure mechanisms and impacts on their families and associates, both cases emphasize the importance of individual responsibility and adherence to safety protocols. Moreover, advancements in medical counter-measures and enhanced healthcare system preparedness have played a vital role in mitigating the effects of these pandemics. Looking forward, continuing efforts to strengthen medical research, healthcare infrastructure, and public health measures will be critical in addressing future pandemics effectively."
